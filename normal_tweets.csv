KenzieElizabeth|all I'm saying is they're out there owning their mistakes, making $$ doing what they love &amp; growing. i hope u can happily do the same
KenzieElizabeth|I experience strong genuine second hand embarrassment anytime I see someone interact w a tweet making fun of anyone like pls get a life bye
KenzieElizabeth|let's stop doing things for retweets and practice what we preach lol
KenzieElizabeth|the internet is SO unforgiving especially from those who preach confidence/self love/kindness/being true to yourselves/etc
KenzieElizabeth|someone will say ONE dumb thing &amp; suddenly that's all anyone knows them for instead of their true selves and good things they've done, sad
KenzieElizabeth|no offense but stop making fun of people you've never met on the internet and do something with your lives
KenzieElizabeth|you need to be selfish with your time if you want to be able to do anything good for you or anyone else ever
KenzieElizabeth|need all new clothes, all new makeup &amp; new hair

Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday awkward. Didn't see @TheJoshElkin's response. I thought I was funny (jk I still think I am)
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday the last minute...
Kacey_Laine|You know when you wake up on Monday, tired from sleeping too much on Sunday? Like I need another day to recover from how hard I napped.
Kacey_Laine|I should be allowed to hibernate for (at least) 3 weeks after today. I was a real adult human and I socialized with other adult humans. 😴😴
Kacey_Laine|I support this 100%. https://t.co/pWQNcHcEWT
Kacey_Laine|This is what it's like to be friends with me 💁 I am just really funny. https://t.co/JF0rwg3Wt0
Kacey_Laine|@MeghanRienks Can you get one with the ice machine on the outside again? Please and thank you.
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday @chrnov @UnRealLifetime I just got my sister hooked on it too. It's amazing. @lifetimetv is killing it 😉
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday @chrnov @UnRealLifetime WERE YOU THE ONE WHO TOLD ME ABOUT THIS FOREVER AGO AND I JUST STARTED WATCHING AND I'M OBSESSED?
Kacey_Laine|The only reason I'm waiting in line at CVS is the music playlist. It's 9:30pm. I wanna go home. Play Fergalicious and you'll keep me here.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan @daniaustin Sending a big hug and lots of love to you!
Kacey_Laine|Remember that time I was driving home, got a speeding ticket, took an extra 2 hours because safety/laws, and then got locked out at 4am?
Kacey_Laine|Dear car listening to loud electronic dance music at 8:30am: Please turn the volume down. I'm trying to listen to a podcast about murder.
Kacey_Laine|@lindseyrem yay for #fitness and yay for #naps!!! 🎉😴
Kacey_Laine|I signed up for a workout class tomorrow morning. Wut. Like who am I? IDONTKNOW. But I'm really excited to nap tomorrow afternoon. 🙏 #me
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov Stop stalking me #creeperchrnov 👨💁
Kacey_Laine|What do you do when you're stuck in LA traffic? According to the driver in front of me, you hit up Tinder. Swiping right at the red light.
Kacey_Laine|Approaching 5 years and cannot agree more. Sending so much love to my first internet BFF, @itscaitlinbea ❤️❤️ https://t.co/6Hsv4uBZla
Kacey_Laine|Do you ever leave a face mask on for way too long and then consider living like that because it hurts too bad to peel off? No? #relatable
Kacey_Laine|Marshall's has their 4th of July decor out and I have no self control. My aesthetic. Me. Welcome to America. Aka Kacey's apartment.
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter @emilyjune_ @AspynOvard I'm dying 😂❤️
Kacey_Laine|I can spend hours on Pinterest crying about how my life is such a mess. I can't make a quiche, so that means I can't do anything in life 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|I just cheered (clapping, yelling, etc) as I got closer to the front of the line at the car wash. Obviously I live a very exciting life 💁🎉😐
Kacey_Laine|@MeghanRienks TELL ME HOW IT IS AND IF ID HATE IT
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu @MeghanRienks @soulcycle I haven't left my bed since I got home from work on Friday...
Kacey_Laine|I apologize if I am late to work today. I was listening to Britney Spears while getting ready and I got distracted.
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy Is it sad that I dropped my goal to 5k bc I hate losing at things. And I didn't reach my goal until I was walking to my bed 😂
Kacey_Laine|I felt like an adult because I paid my taxes on time. That feeling quickly disappeared once I decided dinner was peanut butter 💁😐 Good try.
Kacey_Laine|Filled in my eyebrows while driving on the 405. Would not recommend but I can add it to my list of skills. #perksofLAtraffic #bootygahroo 💁
Kacey_Laine|"I had a package mailed back home &amp; my dad sends me a pic of it saying that his ""fans don't like haul texts"" 💁😂 #beautyguru #areyousubscribed"
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov @catrific classic chrnov 💁👨
Kacey_Laine|Apparently it's raining in LA today. I wouldn't know because I haven't left my bed and my blinds are still closed. But I'll trust y'all ☔️💁
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu I just read your Twitter bio and literally you are the greatest. @MeghanRienks and I need to come see you ASAP.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu I LOVE YOUUUU (and food)
Kacey_Laine|Self tanner means sleeping on top of blankets so I don't ruin my sheets. Sweet dreams 😴💤 (note to self: stop buying white sheets)
Kacey_Laine|@toristerling_ Happy birthday pretty girl! Hope you have an AMAZING day!!! 😘❤️🎉
Kacey_Laine|@NikkiNHollywood yesssss
Kacey_Laine|RIGHT?! I thought it could all be done in an hour. HGTV is a liar.  https://t.co/S0TZ7F2asb
Kacey_Laine|Day 15 in my new home = pretending to unpack, but really just alternating between a mini Britney Spears concert (ft. me) and napping 😐💁
Kacey_Laine|I saw someone snapchatting while driving. Then I saw what they were snapchatting. 100%. #safetyfirst #snapchatsecond https://t.co/Ap764WADkO
Kacey_Laine|BREAKING NEWS. I bought a vacuum after reading at least 3 reviews. And now, I'm like really excited about said vacuum. Adulting? Yes?
Kacey_Laine|I want Chip and Joanna to remodel my apartment. And my life. Does that count as a Fixer Upper?
Kacey_Laine|Today I built a piece of furniture. And I didn't even have to use hot glue.
Kacey_Laine|Spent over an hour on the phone with Time Warner Cable &amp; my Internet still doesn't work. I think they just want me to call back. So clingy 😐
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu yesss 🙌
Kacey_Laine|I found an apartment. But now I have to actually do the whole moving thing. And that sounds like a lot of work. I'll take a nap instead.
Kacey_Laine|Feel like you can't accomplish anything in life? Try learning how to line dance at 11pm on a Wednesday night. You'll probably still fail 💁
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I've been listening to that song on repeat this past week. Ps. I miss you like way too much. Come back into my life.
Kacey_Laine|Also, apartment listings need to address what's important. Are there annoying neighbors? Is wifi fast? What's the Postmates situation like?
Kacey_Laine|There's a time and a place for an artsy photo. I can (pretty much) guarantee that an angled shot of the stove won't sell me on an apartment.
Kacey_Laine|I heard screaming and thought someone was getting attacked outside of my apartment. Nope. Leo won an Oscar.
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip come apartment hunting with me.
Kacey_Laine|"Confidence booster? ""Your eyebrows look great"" At the end of the day. After working out. And no touch ups #bootyguru 💁🏼 (or they're blind)"
Kacey_Laine|"My weekend has consisted of texting my sister Guy Fieri quotes... ""You're like a blackjack dealer at the flavortown casino."""
Kacey_Laine|You know a great way to end the day? A parking ticket.
Kacey_Laine|I had a dream I was in Las Vegas. It was a big disappointment when I woke up. Nope. It's a Thursday and I have to get ready for work.
Kacey_Laine|@MrSilverScott What can I say... I'm pretty talented.
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday Also if you have no butt at all you can't wear them.
Kacey_Laine|Why watch the Super Bowl when there's HGTV on Netflix. Fixer Upper vs Property Brothers? I can watch both... so I'm the real winner 💁
Kacey_Laine|I almost just tweeted about how much I hate tax season, but I realized that wasn't a #relatable thing to tweet on a Friday night 😐💁 #party?
Kacey_Laine|Spent 5 minutes crafting a good tweet before I realized I was on Facebook. Narrowly escaped seeming OLD. Don't worry I'm still young &amp; hip 💁
Kacey_Laine|@Michelle_Potter #relatable 💁
Kacey_Laine|I just had a very heated argument with Siri that ended in tears. WHY DO YOU KEEP TALKING, SIRI??? I think it's time for me to sleep.
Kacey_Laine|But that means there's only 2 people outside so now I can fall asleep. Being social is exhausting (at least from what I can see) 😴😴😴
Kacey_Laine|Update on socializing. They never did a group count so they have now ordered 3 Ubers and still have 2 people left. #strugglesofbeingsocial 😐
Kacey_Laine|I'm socializing on a Saturday night!!! Wait no... the loud people outside are. I'm staring at them, hoping they shut up so I can sleep 😴
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov cool chrnov 💁🍤
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday I DON'T DO WELL WITH CHANGE
Kacey_Laine|I now have all of the (not so) new emojis after updating iOS. Thank you Apple for making me doubt my emoji choices (and my life choices) 😐
Kacey_Laine|I just found out my phone has been eligible for an upgrade since October. WHY DIDN'T I KNOW UNTIL NOW?? #ugh #lifeishard #knowledgeispower
Kacey_Laine|My style says: Hi, I'm a soccer mom from the Midwest who wears jeans with running shoes because I'm hip but I also have joint pain 💁
Kacey_Laine|"@omgbrookeberry I think you also have to include #ad or ""I'm working w/ @God for life"" ... but not 100% sure. @Michelle_Potter, thoughts?"
Kacey_Laine|Please tell me why I am awake at 3am.
Kacey_Laine|The only thing keeping me awake right now is knowing that The Bachelor is on tonight. But I really want to sleep... can I take a nap?
Kacey_Laine|This is me today. This was me yesterday. This is me basically all the time. [subtweet to life] https://t.co/vFpZtPRCza
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAbe Neither.
Kacey_Laine|I spent the last 30 minutes reading my own tweets. I do this more often than I'd like to admit (and I've said it before)... but I'm funny.
Kacey_Laine|I have the sleep schedule of a jet-lagged new parent. But I haven't been traveling. And I have no kid. So I just have insomnia 👌😴
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves AH IS IT BEBE TIME YET!!!! ps I miss you and the fam 💗💗
Kacey_Laine|2:50am is a great time to wake up and not be able to fall back asleep. Good idea, Kacey. You're so smart (now go back to sleep please) 😐
Kacey_Laine|I'm sorry. Ben thinks he might be unlovable... has he met me? (No he has not) 😐🌹 #TheBachelor
Kacey_Laine|@catrific Booking my own flight? Duhhhhh he was dumb.
Kacey_Laine|THE BACHELOR IS BACK. Not like you didn't already know that based on the billion tweets, but here's another because I love it so much 🌹😍
Kacey_Laine|Constantly amazed and inspired by my best friend 💗💗 https://t.co/q58padWgGS
Kacey_Laine|@LindsayJernigan I WANT.
Kacey_Laine|ME. https://t.co/Si0bNToTWT
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAbe I was almost engaged in preschool (def when I peaked). Now at 21, I'm spending Saturday night watching Netflix, &amp; I am so single 💁😐
Kacey_Laine|Why would anyone take their children to IKEA? Like who decided that was a good family outing?
Kacey_Laine|You know when it's NYE and everyone is out partying but you are forever tired and sick so you are in bed before 7pm? Hi. Me. Happy 2016.
Kacey_Laine|People I've texted today: my dad, my sister, and Postmates. Accurate representation of my social life (or lack of).
Kacey_Laine|Today at lunch I was asked my age bc they wanted to give us the kids discount (ages 6-12). I'm 21 so I think the waiter was hitting on me 💁
Kacey_Laine|Football is on and I ask to change it to HGTV. Apparently that's a quick way to get uninvited places. Sorry I wanna watch House Hunters 😐💁
Kacey_Laine|@Kacey_Laine I'd like to blame it on jet lag. But in reality, I didn't travel anywhere. I just really love sleep.
Kacey_Laine|It's 6:30pm and I'm already in bed ready to sleep. Welcome home, Kacey.
Kacey_Laine|Holiday movie recommendation: Santa Paws 2. It's got singing puppies and it's a sequel. What more could you ask for? (A better movie)
Kacey_Laine|@lily_marston Or because I'm an extreme couponer who is interested in her financial wellbeing?
Kacey_Laine|@lily_marston because I'm #relatable? 💁
Kacey_Laine|I'm leaving LA tomorrow &amp; I haven't packed. What am I doing instead? Laying in bed, looking for food delivery coupons. I'm not even hungry.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu You are my favorite 😂😂😂😂
Kacey_Laine|Wait. I thought I was Miss Universe... Steve Harvey, did you announce it wrong again? Silly goose 👑💁
Kacey_Laine|I sneezed while doing my mascara. Today is officially ruined. Can I go back to sleep? I give up.
Kacey_Laine|The only thing that got me out of bed today? Serial Season 2.
Kacey_Laine|I lit a Bath &amp; Body Works candle and called that my menorah for tonight. I'm really good at being an adult. #KaceyCelebratesChannukah
Kacey_Laine|My shoulder hurts really bad so I'm using a can of Diet Coke to roll the knots out. It's not working. Diet Coke... please don't betray me.
Kacey_Laine|To the couple being all cute and in love inside of Sephora. Please stop. I'm just trying to not be ugly and you're making me sad.
Kacey_Laine|I'm in my car and can't move (because I haven't tried). Will someone please come get me and carry me to my bed in my apartment? Thanks.
Kacey_Laine|@daniaustin I NEED TO FOLLOW.
Kacey_Laine|Was on the biggest emotional roller coaster for the last 1.5 hours. I laughed. I cried. What was I doing? Watching The Bee Movie. 10/10
Kacey_Laine|@kairdv sending so much love ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|@ryancharch Right?! Thanksgiving is a family holiday. Why don't you want to be a part of my family, @ChipotleTweets? PLEASE LOVE ME.
Kacey_Laine|@ryancharch @ChipotleTweets I waited outside last night. And then found out they were closed.
Kacey_Laine|BOGO burritos. Make it happen, @ChipotleTweets.  https://t.co/5QBGbLdNeH
Kacey_Laine|Black Friday shopping is complete. What did I buy? Trail mix, lasagna, and Diet Coke. None of it was on sale. I just wanted to go to Target.
Kacey_Laine|Location: gas station bathroom in the middle of nowhere. Shoutout to the stylist of this festive establishment. https://t.co/IHSqBmzEHS
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov Was this the exciting opportunity? https://t.co/TmJY4FFHZd
Kacey_Laine|@LacyCavalier same. Except he's actually your boyfriend. And I'm alone. I need to come to Nashville and find a boyfriend.
Kacey_Laine|I had so much stuff I had to do this weekend, and I got approximately none of it done. BUT I did nap so hard that I needed to nap more 😐👌
Kacey_Laine|@CarlieStylezz Cannot stop smiling while watching the video 😍 Miss you lots and sending so much love to you and the family!
Kacey_Laine|I just woke up from a 5 hour nap. Is it time for bed now?
Kacey_Laine|Yesterday I tried to get into my apartment using my mail key. Today? My car key 😐 I don't think I should be allowed to call myself an adult.
Kacey_Laine|LA, you are way too cold and I feel like I'm going to die so can you please stop because I have way too much to do this week.
Kacey_Laine|I just found a Diet Coke bottle underneath the fitted sheet on my bed. I don't know how it got there. But it sounds like something I'd do...
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO BAE!!!! LOVE YOUUUUUUUUU 💗💃🎉
Kacey_Laine|@MeghanRienks can we get chipotle tomorrow?... and can you just text me anything you need from home/or wherever. Now I can sleep longer.
Kacey_Laine|"""Heavy traffic reported ahead."" Oh thanks Waze. I wasn't able to figure that out on my own. While I'm completely stopped at a green light 😐🔫"
Kacey_Laine|@carrierad My fave. Thanks Ralphy for your tips. I now look beautiful.
Kacey_Laine|@ryancharch HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! Now come to LA and hang out with me 💃🎉
Kacey_Laine|Some nights I get really sad because I can't be Britney Spears. And when I say some nights, I mean ALL nights. I just want to be BSpears.
Kacey_Laine|The music at the grocery store this morning is 👌 Britney Spears and Hilary Duff. Good job Ralph's. I don't hate it here.
Kacey_Laine|Dedicated birthday tweet to amateur magician, professional broseph, and the creator of #RidicChicken. HAPPY BIRTHDAY @CHRNOV 💁👨🎉💃
Kacey_Laine|@m_callahan duh subtweet to penelope. I know she doesn't have Twitter but I sense her stalking.
Kacey_Laine|@m_callahan but actually. you da bestest 💗
Kacey_Laine|@m_callahan i love you
Kacey_Laine|Okay, it's finally 8pm. Goodnight world 😴😴😴
Kacey_Laine|Is it too early to go to sleep? It's not even 7pm yet. This whole daylight savings thing is throwing me off. But also, I love it.
Kacey_Laine|You know when you feel like absolute death and you can't move from your bed so you just sleep all day? Yeah... 😐😩🔫
Kacey_Laine|Happy birthday mommy ❤️ I would do anything to get just one more day with you. I love you, forever and always. https://t.co/QGOBcLF9Ql
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday @catrific cosmic without a doubt. Why would you want to wake up and instantly feel like you're drowning? 🙅 No thx
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov 💁🐓🕓 is not widely recognized by the world (or anyone other than you) yet.
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov 8:58pm. There are machines that tell these things just fyi. Not a big guessing game.
Kacey_Laine|Just saw a Chuck E. Cheese's with valet. When I have kids, that will be the only one we go to. Because it says I'm classy but like to party.
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter you are my favorite.
Kacey_Laine|I got sad because my snapchat story with the Britney Spears concert is almost done and that means it's actually over 😭 No, take me back.
Kacey_Laine|The only way you can get me excited for Halloween is if you tell me I can wear a tutu and be Penelope Disick. (thank you @m_callahan 👯)
Kacey_Laine|@m_callahan Can I be Penelope? (Not the dog. Because I am her daily)
Kacey_Laine|Wearing sunglasses inside while leaving Vegas- not because I'm hungover, just because I'm ugly.
Kacey_Laine|I want to be Britney Spears. Like please let me be her. Thanks.
Kacey_Laine|@MeghanRienks why am I so beautiful?
Kacey_Laine|So much love to @AspynOvard and @ParkerFerris 💗💗
Kacey_Laine|@m_callahan @LindsayJernigan @MeghanRienks I love you all &amp; I'm so happy we have friends now (*by we I mean me bc y'all were social before)
Kacey_Laine|We don't love you.  https://t.co/re8OMmj3wA
Kacey_Laine|#CONFIDENT is the only way I can get through my morning emails (and all day at work) 💃🎉 https://t.co/oARlkiHEjb
Kacey_Laine|Just answered the door with no pants on. Because why would I put on pants... give me my food &amp; leave please. I'm not trying to impress you.
Kacey_Laine|I bought a camouflage shirt yesterday. So if that's any indication of how my life is going... it's not. I just wanted a camouflage shirt.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Always sending you so much love &lt;3333
Kacey_Laine|@MeghanRienks Not allowed because I am in LA. Come home please.
Kacey_Laine|When I grow up, I want to be @amyschumer.
Kacey_Laine|@thebravobunch Today was National Boss Day AND National Feral Cat Day, and I just found out. I'm disappointed in your holiday celebrations 😐
Kacey_Laine|My hair is in a ponytail today because I burnt my hand on my curling iron. Please respect my space while I care for my injured hand and ego.
Kacey_Laine|LA is way too hot so I'm laying in front of my fan and sleeping all day.
Kacey_Laine|Amazon recommendations + next day shipping is a dangerous combo. I now own a John Deere keychain 👌 (actually I don't regret this at all)
Kacey_Laine|I'm blind. If I would have just gone to my car to get my glasses, this wouldn't be a problem. But it's more fun to pretend I'm Helen Keller.
Kacey_Laine|Driving in LA reminds me how much I love people (aka not at all) (aka move out of the way please) (aka 😐🔫)
Kacey_Laine|I'm wearing my college sweatshirt today so TBT to when that was a thing in my life. (tbh I only bought it for the giant horse on the back)
Kacey_Laine|@daniaustin @backstreetboys YESSS. Can we go back pleaseeeee?
Kacey_Laine|I only speak the truth 💁 http://t.co/5KkGbG7Ng8
Kacey_Laine|LA. You know I love you, but this heat... no 😐
Kacey_Laine|@Michelle_Potter I just got a call from a blocked number, so of course I ignored it.
Kacey_Laine|I'm shutting off my phone forever. If any of my friends try to reach me, ha 😐
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov @MaxPolisar wow. Really could have used those today. My eyes were dry. If I go blind, I'm blaming you both.
Kacey_Laine|The reason I don't make friends is because I care about people. I know I'm the funnier friend and I don't want to crush their dreams.
Kacey_Laine|I refuse to check Snapchat after these updates because it's terrifying and I will start crying.
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov Talents include magic, entertaining brosephs, being old enough to take a 15 year hiatus 👌 Add that to your linkedin page.
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov re-found this. Un-favorited just so I could re-favorite. This tweet could win awards.
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov @lisaflip I won't have internet in Montana so you'll have to keep your sassy attitude to yourself. Go back to practicing magic.
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov @lisaflip Uhmmm...it's actually an ox. It's popular for pulling a plow and harvesting crops. You know, basic Montana knowledge.
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip @chrnov Business expense?? Pretty sure I have chrnov's card info somewhere 😏🐂
Kacey_Laine|Also, when I say live off the land, I actually mean die on the land because I don't know how to hunt or fish. Or be a regular human...
Kacey_Laine|I've made my decision. I'm getting rid of all communication with the real world and I'm moving to Montana where I'll live off the land.
Kacey_Laine|Going to sleep at 7pm so I can wake up at 1am, so I can then drive across California to get to LA in time for work. Wish me luck.
Kacey_Laine|I just want to sleep forever and maybe wake up to eat snacks.
Kacey_Laine|Father-daughter bonding time = watching 8 Mile 👌 gotta love Eminem.
Kacey_Laine|Also while at the beach, I saw a pregnant lady running. It almost inspired me to run. Then I decided not to... (but I thought about it)
Kacey_Laine|@catrific back home right now/not in LA. Hahah
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz surprisingly not even in LA!! 🙈😂
Kacey_Laine|While at the beach, I just saw a cat on a leash. With a studded vest on. Like fully serious. That is a real thing.
Kacey_Laine|@MeghanRienks that's really been the overall goal of the past 5 years.
Kacey_Laine|I'm so thankful to have @MeghanRienks in my life. Mainly because she has an ice maker. But also because she's the bestest friend ever 👯
Kacey_Laine|Grocery shopping at 2am. Because what else would insomnia look like?
Kacey_Laine|When everything in life is falling apart, keep going. It probs won't get better. But it gives you more time to flirt your way to free guac.
Kacey_Laine|Constantly killing it 💁👏 @lisaflip, you're my hero. https://t.co/hCxF2cTfBU
Kacey_Laine|Why do I wear workout clothes when I'm not working out? Because I'm always ready to win. In the game of life. #MVP #fitspiration #orjustlazy
Kacey_Laine|Don't snap &amp; drive, kids. But if you do, do it because @tyleroakley is on a building &amp; you gotta promo @lisaflip 👏😘 http://t.co/5vF0O7FNpW
Kacey_Laine|I didn't leave my apartment/bed all weekend. This is the result. http://t.co/RnG5WaTVLB
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!! Sending so much love 💗💗
Kacey_Laine|I thought I lost my Apple TV remote and spent 30 seconds wondering what I'd do with my life. Then I found it next to me. All is well now.
Kacey_Laine|It's 8pm and I'm in bed ready to sleep. As a note, I haven't left my bed since Friday night and I spent all day napping. I have no regrets.
Kacey_Laine|Netflix needs to stop judging me. Am I still watching? Yes. Does it look like I have other plans for tonight... because I don't.
Kacey_Laine|I forgot to get Diet Coke with my @Postmates order and so it's quite possibly the worst day ever. I may be a little overdramatic but 😭😭😭
Kacey_Laine|I apologize that I'm no longer capable of being a real human. I'm going to die and come back to life as a rock (or some other non-human).
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov Look at chrnov coming in with the AM inspiration.
Kacey_Laine|Dear guy at Chipotle who said I had great eyebrows: between giving me guac and that compliment, you made my day.
Kacey_Laine|Dear guy on rollerblades: I'm sure you're doing really difficult tricks but I'm not impressed so please stop staring at me 😐 Thanks
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov Mehh that's a little basic. It kinda sounds like prostitutes from Postmates. Not sure if that's the goal... or if that's legal.
Kacey_Laine|I would really benefit from learning more about cars. Or having friends that know about cars. Or having friends in general...
Kacey_Laine|General word of advice. Don't try to change shirts while driving in Downtown LA. It doesn't work. (Not that I know from personal experience)
Kacey_Laine|It's #VMA day. I'm hoping to be asleep by 8. (Aka it's just like every other day where it'll be a miracle if I make it till 8) 😴😴😴
Kacey_Laine|I need a Diet Coke and a nap.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo @LacyCavalier I MISS MY LOVES 💗💗
Kacey_Laine|"I met my ""neighbor"" tonight in the elevator. Aka an old guy in a camo shirt who lives a floor below me. Aka my new best friend."
Kacey_Laine|The power keeps going out while I'm getting ready and it's making this whole hair drying process really terrible.
Kacey_Laine|Also, I've decided that I'm really going to thrive at being 40. Like once it's okay to watch HGTV and be anti-social. That'll be my prime.
Kacey_Laine|I wanna become a regular at a restaurant so I don't have to make friends. I could befriend the bartender. They're like a built-in friend.
Kacey_Laine|@itsbl0ndie @carrieunderwood LOVE 😍
Kacey_Laine|Help. I've been listening to Taylor Swift nonstop since the concert. (jk don't help. I am 100% fine with this life choice bc she's perfect)
Kacey_Laine|Time for the apartment search to begin. My requests? Large closet, laundry onsite, and walking distance to a Chipotle.
Kacey_Laine|How do I get invited into @taylorswift13's squad? I'm really good at choreographed dance. That should get me in.
Kacey_Laine|@carrierad I feel like Dmitri would def be TSwift's security guard. That's why he couldn't tell me.
Kacey_Laine|Taylor Swift is in a fully bedazzled jumpsuit. She is actual goals.
Kacey_Laine|JOEY FROM FRIENDS IS HERE. HOW YOU DOIN?
Kacey_Laine|She's so perfect 😍😍😍 http://t.co/Un37HbnPFE
Kacey_Laine|AHHHHHH I CANNOT CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT FOR TAYLOR SWIFT RIGHT NOW
Kacey_Laine|But Twitter app stress aside... guess who's going to see TSwift tonight? ADKHJFALKJDFA;DS 😬😍 @MeghanRienks
Kacey_Laine|I updated my Twitter app and it's stressing me out because it looks different 😬 I don't do well with change.
Kacey_Laine|Remember that time I ate trail mix for dinner? Oh yeah... that was tonight. And last night. And the night before. #adult
Kacey_Laine|@AspynOvard AHHH THESE ARE PERFECT AND Y'ALL ARE PERFECT. Congratulations!!! 💗💗
Kacey_Laine|I've worn the same watch almost every day this week (see previous tweet) and I just realized that it doesn't work... cool 😐👌
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov I'm glad you're beginning to appreciate the wonderful world of pageantry.
Kacey_Laine|@MeghanRienks I fully support this decision.
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday yes. The tensed up arms were distracting me from my driving 😐😏
Kacey_Laine|Taking Waze never works for me because I always decide I know a better way and then I get stuck in traffic with my GPS trying to reroute me.
Kacey_Laine|@meggybearz IM FINE NOW. IT WAS JUST THEN. ALL IS WELL.
Kacey_Laine|"I'm wearing a watch today because it says ""I'm always on time"" and ""I planned enough to actually accessorize"". Aka... I'm an adult 💁"
Kacey_Laine|"I just texted my sister Britney Spear's lyrics and her response was, ""I don't get it."" 😐 how are we even related?"
Kacey_Laine|I feel like waking up to cough up blood should be more concerning than it is. But I just want to sleep. I'll deal with my health tomorrow.
Kacey_Laine|@ryancharch I'm dying 😂😂😂 (but no judgement cuz guac is worth it)
Kacey_Laine|@daniaustin ahhh hahaha I MISS YOUUUUU 😘😭
Kacey_Laine|I wish I was a bear so I could hibernate. Or I wish it was socially acceptable to sleep for a week and not talk to people. Either is fine.
Kacey_Laine|Want to look like an idiot in LA? Just ride a rollerboard in the bike lane of the street. I will honk at you.
Kacey_Laine|Socializing is exhausting. I don't really know this from personal experience, but I'm watching Bachelor in Paradise and it looks like it is.
Kacey_Laine|These birds outside my window are very loud and annoying. I didn't even know we had birds in LA.
Kacey_Laine|I can't tell if I got a tan line in Vegas, or if it's just where my bathing suit rubbed off my fake tan...
Kacey_Laine|I will say though... I could probably put together a good pageant routine. I think it'd be a hit. Yes? Vegas? Can I come stay forever? 👸🎰
Kacey_Laine|So who do I need to talk to about getting me residency in Las Vegas? I don't have any talents that I can perform- I just really love Vegas.
Kacey_Laine|We asked for handwritten notes with our leftovers (aka the chocolate cake that we're saving). Thank you @LavoLV for being our favorite 😍🎂
Kacey_Laine|Vegas was the most disappointing Chipotle experience of my life. No Diet Coke and no guac 😭😭😭
Kacey_Laine|Look who's being social... (kinda) http://t.co/q5FwUeKdpR
Kacey_Laine|Hello? Vegas? (Oh wait, no. We're still in traffic) 😐
Kacey_Laine|I'm going to Vegas tomorrow, so naturally I'm shopping at 11pm because I have no real clothes. Can I wear workout pants with my heels?
Kacey_Laine|HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY FAVORITE @MeghanRienks!!! Love you so so much and can't wait to celebrate! 👸🎉💗
Kacey_Laine|It's 3am. Why am I not asleep?
Kacey_Laine|So I'm just going to stay in bed and sleep forever, okay? Please don't try and make me leave. Thanks.
Kacey_Laine|@cescadarling thank you!!! Miss you lots 💗💗💗
Kacey_Laine|First Friday night as a 21 year old. Am I doing this adult thing right? http://t.co/JxfVhST4CM
Kacey_Laine|I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat, so I had peanut butter for dinner. This is real adulthood, right?
Kacey_Laine|@MeghanRienks WOOOOOOOOO 🎉🎉
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter hahahah thank youuuu &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|We can pretend that this is me tonight. But it's not... I was 5. My desire to party ended in 1999. http://t.co/EWMffKEEBn
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov Good work chrnov. Thannnksssssss 💁
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Thank you! Love you oh so much! 💗💗
Kacey_Laine|@carrierad thank you my loveeee ❤️🎉
Kacey_Laine|How am I spending the eve of my 21st birthday? PARTYYY 🎉🎉🎉 lolz jk I'm hoping to be in bed by 9.
Kacey_Laine|Got home last night and couldn't find my phone charger. So I ordered one on Amazon at 1am. It was just delivered. I love Amazon Prime 🙌
Kacey_Laine|@thebravobunch no comma needed...
Kacey_Laine|@MakeupbyMandy24 Happy birthday pretty girl!!! Hope you have an amazing day! 💗🎉
Kacey_Laine|@hannnahwilsonn Thank you so much, Hannah! You are too sweet &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|If I seem like I hate the world, it's because I just got home from VidCon.
Kacey_Laine|"""I wish I had games to play... you know like Yahtzee."" Actual statement from me to @eileeneveryday at VidCon 👌🎲"
Kacey_Laine|It's time for HGTV and a nap. I'm really good at this whole socializing thing.
Kacey_Laine|I have nothing to wear to VidCon. Are workout clothes acceptable? I like to be prepared for possible exercise... (jk that's all I ever wear)
Kacey_Laine|8 days until my 21st birthday and I'm in bed before 7pm. I would say that's going to change after next week, but it won't. I like sleep.
Kacey_Laine|I went to Starbucks and the Post Office before realizing I was wearing two different shoes... today's going great so far 😐
Kacey_Laine|It's not even 6:30am and I have managed to lock myself out of my apartment. It's going to be a great day 😐
Kacey_Laine|I like laying in bed and watching Netflix. That's honestly the highlight of my day. Property Brothers is great when there's no commercials.
Kacey_Laine|Remember when I used to be social and have lots of friends? (ha no, because that never happened)
Kacey_Laine|Country playlist on, driving 6 hours through lightning storms to get back to LA. Kacey's road trip adventures are fun 💁🚙
Kacey_Laine|This really was my prime. You could have put me in pageants. What was my talent? Being adorable. http://t.co/SJLzkFG9kY
Kacey_Laine|Who goes to see a movie at 10:45am? Me. And old people.
Kacey_Laine|"Currently at a rodeo. Operation ""Kacey Finds a Cowboy"" begins now. 🏇🇺🇸❤️"
Kacey_Laine|I've spent the last hour watching HGTV and searching online to find the best notebook and planner. Once again, I am a middle aged woman.
Kacey_Laine|My dad now keeps the fridge stocked with only green juice. I'm home for 4 days so I bought a case of Diet Coke just for me. #dietcokeiscrack
Kacey_Laine|Remind me to never get old.
Kacey_Laine|"I really should stop ending professional emails with ""Kthxbyeeeeee"" 😐💁"
Kacey_Laine|Yep. That happened. #everydaybaeissorelatable  https://t.co/SWvjU40wQ3
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan @daniaustin Sending you so much love my dear! You're the best &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|@MeghanRienks @MarissaLace Wasn't Jose. It was Philip. I'm glad we have plenty of hot postmates nearby 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|I can't tell if he was actually hot, or if I just like that he brought me food and Diet Coke. Maybe both. #PostMates (get it? ha I'm funny)
Kacey_Laine|When the guy who delivers your food is really attractive 😐 please don't judge my dinner choice and current state of appearance. Thanks.
Kacey_Laine|I'm realizing that the older I get, the more my style is quickly becoming an exact replica of my mother's.
Kacey_Laine|I left my apartment and was (kinda) social today. I am so proud of me. I'm now going to lay in bed and watch Netflix until Monday. Bye.
Kacey_Laine|I got two fortune cookies and neither of them inspired me. Why did I even get Chinese food? (because of the chow mein... it was really good)
Kacey_Laine|I reallllyyyyyy don't want to unpack my stuff. So instead I'm going to watch The Bachelorette &amp; pretend I don't have a billion things to do.
Kacey_Laine|I like how old people always seem to have rain coats. Like have they just lived so much life that they can come to expect random storms?
Kacey_Laine|Hopped off the plane at LAX with a dream and my cardigan. Jk I'm wearing a sweatshirt and my dreams are all crushed. But LA, I have arrived.
Kacey_Laine|So close... http://t.co/WbOziiqfkk
Kacey_Laine|If you see a girl laying on the floor at the gym- hi, that's me. Please bring a water and maybe carry me home. I'm tired.
Kacey_Laine|HGTV snapchat artwork. I know, it's beautiful. I'm so talented 😐😭 http://t.co/X3Te0RVb62
Kacey_Laine|I'm on vacation and have to be up early. What am I doing right now? Watching House Hunters (of course). Gonna find my Montana home 🏡🇺🇸
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves AHHHH! Sending so much love to my faves 😍❤️🎉
Kacey_Laine|On the plane seated next to a couple that's clearly in love. While they're being cute and all, I'm waiting for my Diet Coke. #myonetruelove
Kacey_Laine|I am so excited to drive to LAX in rush hour traffic right after a holiday weekend. Like that just sounds like SO much fun (not at all) 😐
Kacey_Laine|I'm stressed about everything and there's too much I need to do, so I'm laying in bed and ignoring it all. If you need to reach me, don't.
Kacey_Laine|I have so much to do before I go on vacation tomorrow but instead of actually doing any of it, I'm bedazzling a canvas (just because).
Kacey_Laine|Happy 5th of July! (I just really love America so I'm pretending today is another holiday) 🇺🇸 #goUSA
Kacey_Laine|The best way to celebrate America's independence? Watching a movie about strippers and then driving through the ghetto to see fireworks 🇺🇸
Kacey_Laine|@thebravobunch I hate you.
Kacey_Laine|I'm using the 4th of July as my excuse for wearing denim on denim and a bandana 💁🇺🇸 #America
Kacey_Laine|One more picture. Because I love America. http://t.co/Xt8tcQTFa2
Kacey_Laine|I'm laying in bed, watching HGTV, and I can hear the ocean outside my window. This may be my favorite place. Oh and I have Diet Coke.
Kacey_Laine|I went on an adventure. And then that adventure got ruined by fog. This is why I don't do nature. http://t.co/0abOLsmsOA
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes you just need to escape the real world and pretend everything is okay. Because it will be, eventually. http://t.co/XLl7po24M9
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday literally me.
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie AHH!! Happy birthday!!!!
Kacey_Laine|Whenever I'm sad, I read through my own tweets because I think I'm really funny. I am my own #1 fan 💁 #inspiration #me
Kacey_Laine|I was eating applesauce and then I had to sneeze, and it was a very scary moment. (Please pray for me) 🙏
Kacey_Laine|My birthday is in exactly one month. I think I'm most excited to turn 21 so I can finally play bingo at the casinos in Las Vegas.
Kacey_Laine|@thebravobunch we're*
Kacey_Laine|I'm kind of mad I got my AC fixed in my car because now it gets too cold. These are the struggles I deal with (feel bad for me).
Kacey_Laine|The Backstreet Boys movie is on Netflix. See, I told you I had plans for Saturday night 💁
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie YES! Hahah so good 😍 and you are amazing 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|Because I'm basic and want to prove that waiting 20 minutes in the drive thru line was worth it 💁 http://t.co/OpqyjNA84a
Kacey_Laine|Saturday mornings with Kacey: 20 minutes spent in line at the drive thru Starbucks because I didn't want to leave my car.
Kacey_Laine|Saturday morning before 6am. That's a normal time for a 20 year old to be awake. #partyanimal #hakiddingimagrandma #hashtagsarerelatable
Kacey_Laine|I just got the urge to go for a run. Since when do I run/exercise? I don't know. I think I'll lay in bed and watch Netflix instead.
Kacey_Laine|Maybe the reason I'm single is because boyfriend jeans look terrible on me. Just an idea... (or maybe it's because I hate socializing) 😐💁
Kacey_Laine|I'm so much fun.  https://t.co/VunzmgpxL2
Kacey_Laine|Can I hire a pageant coach to teach me how to be a human? Like I think I need a personal trainer...for living. But I want to win a crown.
Kacey_Laine|I need to eat dinner, but I'd rather sleep. I feel like this is a common theme in my life. Why be a real human, when I can sleep instead?
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov one of my many talents 💁 I'll find string on Friday to hang it.
Kacey_Laine|Apparently today is the longest day of the year. How am I supposed to go to sleep at 8pm if it's still light out?
Kacey_Laine|I choose my friends based on who has access to HGTV. Shoutout to @lisaflip for showing me where she keeps her house key 😘 #friendshipgoals
Kacey_Laine|"""Someone died at the gym last week. Just fell over on the elliptical."" 😐 Wow dad, that's a cool story..."
Kacey_Laine|Oh hey. That's my face.  https://t.co/98zI4sRiNz
Kacey_Laine|Is it still considered a nap if I have no intention of leaving my bed anytime soon...
Kacey_Laine|I made the mistake of watching a Nicholas Sparks movie in the middle of the day and now I'm too sad and emotional to do anything else 😭😍😭
Kacey_Laine|During my 6 hour solo road trip, 50% of the time I'm thinking about life. The other 50% is spent pretending I'm Britney Spears circa 2001.
Kacey_Laine|So last night I decided I would cut my hair on my own. 3 inches gone and I'm really impressed with myself. I have so many hidden talents 💁
Kacey_Laine|Continuing my education out in the real world today. It's like a school of fish... (am I funny yet?) http://t.co/kGF8NImZdG
Kacey_Laine|Sleep is a good excuse for not socializing, right? I'm sorry that I love my bed more than any human. But I'm not really that sorry 😴❤️
Kacey_Laine|Who wore it better: bucket hat edition. http://t.co/z0FlpT4P7k
Kacey_Laine|Does the flea market have valet parking? Asking for a friend... @sarahbelle93 @glamourista16
Kacey_Laine|@glamourista16 *flea
Kacey_Laine|Help. I started watching Mad Men this morning and now it's 11:25pm and I haven't left my bed all day. I don't know if this is a problem...
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip I la la la la love youuuuuuu 💗✈️🇺🇸 (Montana)
Kacey_Laine|I went to the grocery store to actually buy food. Then I decided I didn't want to, so I bought a case of Diet Coke and left. #priorities
Kacey_Laine|I can't tell if there was just an earthquake, or if I moved very violently and woke myself up. Either way... back to sleep 😴
Kacey_Laine|180 miles to go. This is why I love California. http://t.co/7xB57Sci1A
Kacey_Laine|It's hard to believe it's been 4 years, but this view will always remind me of you.  I love you mommy. http://t.co/fLTr7tfn5F
Kacey_Laine|A sneak peek into my night. Aka bragging via snapchat about all of my talents and life achievements. http://t.co/gXhmAozSeI
Kacey_Laine|"Me: Hey dad, do you have wrapping paper?
Dad: Yeah, I got this one with cool snowmen on it. They have top hats. http://t.co/cAPrOMArGr"
Kacey_Laine|I have never been happier to get to sleep in my bed back home. Time to sleep forever 😴❤️
Kacey_Laine|Dear boys in the In-N-Out parking lot: y'all are real attractive, but I want to leave and you're standing behind my car. I will hit you.
Kacey_Laine|I don't have time to be sick 😩🔫
Kacey_Laine|Do you ever start falling asleep, then wake up. And then think about how excited you are to sleep. Like my love for sleep is so real 😴❤️
Kacey_Laine|I think I set my alarm for the morning. But I don't really remember. And I'm too tired to check. So I'm just trusting past me. #trustinjesus
Kacey_Laine|As a reward for being a real life human today, it's 9:45pm and I'm in bed watching House Hunters. #partytime #squadgoals #jkimbymyself
Kacey_Laine|Why would I go grocery shopping when I could instead just go to Chipotle? Good life choices, Kacey.
Kacey_Laine|I need to go grocery shopping but instead of actually doing that, I'm texting my dad that I'm hungry and I have no food. I'm not an adult.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE ASAP.
Kacey_Laine|I don't remember the last time I got fully ready. But guess who is out in the world looking somewhat presentable? (me)
Kacey_Laine|Dear mailman, 8:30pm is not the time to deliver packages. I thought we went over this already. I want to be asleep, not answering the door.
Kacey_Laine|“@eileeneveryday: @Kacey_Laine just heated up a blanket in the dryer because she's cold. Just a normal day at work.” Living it up at #BaeHQ.
Kacey_Laine|Does Diet Coke expire? #foreveralone #jkidontwannashare 💁 http://t.co/MIK5sUxuyk
Kacey_Laine|I feel like I could cut my own hair. Like I have a false sense of confidence that makes me think I could do it. [note to self: don't do it]
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood I tell them it's an order for 3 people so I get more fortune cookies. And then it doesn't look like I'm eating alone 😂
Kacey_Laine|One of the greatest feelings in life is looking in the fridge and seeing that you still have leftover Chinese food. #relatabletweet
Kacey_Laine|Choreographing my pageant routine to Toxic by Britney Spears. Is this not what normal people do on a Saturday night?
Kacey_Laine|Today's soundtrack? Britney Spears. Greatest Hits: My Prerogative. Obviously the only way to make it through Friday.
Kacey_Laine|On a scale of 1 to 10, how acceptable is it to order delivery from the same place twice in one week? (tbh I'm going to do it no matter what)
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan @daniaustin Happy graduation day!! :D
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood my life motto.
Kacey_Laine|Wednesday. That seems like a perfectly acceptable day to wear sweatpants to work. Right? #kaceyvsrealhumanworld
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan love!!!!
Kacey_Laine|The Bachelorette is back. My life is complete again.
Kacey_Laine|I have the sleep schedule of a brand new baby. Except after I wake up, I watch HGTV till I fall back asleep.
Kacey_Laine|Casual conversation with Kacey. http://t.co/wOeQTS9dOE
Kacey_Laine|I think I was awake for maybe 3 hours total today. Naps are my favorite thing in the world and I'm really good at them 😴😴😴
Kacey_Laine|@catrific happy birthday!!!! 💗🎉🎈
Kacey_Laine|After watching HGTV all day, I decided I want to buy a house &amp; a baby goat. We'd make so many friends. Haven't worked out all the details.
Kacey_Laine|@MHmusic44 ...that's me today. And tomorrow.
Kacey_Laine|The auto-play option on Netflix is great. Until it cuts out before the episode is done. Don't do that to me. DID THEY LOVE IT OR LIST IT?!?!
Kacey_Laine|House Hunters. Sleep. Eat. Repeat. That's my plan for the next 48 hours.
Kacey_Laine|I just spent 5 minutes trying to open my apartment using my mail key. I promise I can function as a human in the real world...
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan congrats beautiful! Have an amazing day!!!
Kacey_Laine|I'm falling asleep while watching House Hunters. Aka I am a middle aged housewife living in South Carolina. #dreambig #ineedagrandfireplace
Kacey_Laine|I may have found my new favorite Netflix show. Polar Bear: Spy on Ice. It's a BBC documentary about polar bear vloggers (essentially).
Kacey_Laine|Today, I got attacked by a tree while I was driving. I didn't know that was possible... but it is. And it happened.
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie Love you Angie &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|@becker1995 Sending so much love to you &lt;3
Kacey_Laine|I can only hope that I'm living my life in a way that would make you proud. I love you mommy, forever and always. http://t.co/h5Nlr9k2qp
Kacey_Laine|@MsMeghanMakeup I just randomly woke up and saw this and now I'm really craving it too... 😂
Kacey_Laine|I just spent the last 45 minutes reading through my own Twitter. I'm really funny. I would follow me.
Kacey_Laine|Umm...since when do Snuggie's have pockets?!?!?!
Kacey_Laine|It's 5am and I've been up for a half hour. My body apparently decided that it no longer needs sleep... we'll see how long that works 😐👏
Kacey_Laine|The only problem of living alone is there's no one to help me wrap myself up like a blanket burrito. Or untangle me when I get strangled.
Kacey_Laine|@cescadarling I'll get us all matching ones. Bedazzled. @eileeneveryday @ingridnilsen pick your color. http://t.co/gaAGyfani6
Kacey_Laine|@cescadarling My attire for wednesday?? 😏
Kacey_Laine|@catrific @cescadarling Where do footie pajamas fit into this mix? They're like full body boots...maybe.
Kacey_Laine|@meghanrosette Laying in bed watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians and eating a popsicle. And I want Gloria's soon. And to see your face.
Kacey_Laine|"Some guy at the pet store just walked over to the bunnies and yelled out ""Carnitas!"" No, that's meat at Chipotle. You're thinking conejito."
Kacey_Laine|"Lady at Lululemon: ""These are good for yoga or Pilates, while these provide support for running.""
Me: ""Okay, so which are best for naps?"""
Kacey_Laine|While everyone else is watching the fight, I'm watching my love @SamHuntMusic. Marry me please 😍😭 #iHeartCountry
Kacey_Laine|"I know what you're thinking: ""Wow Kacey- you are such a social butterfly with crazy weekend plans and I'm jealous."" 💁 #sorryimsopopular"
Kacey_Laine|I have a very exciting Saturday night planned. Currently backing up my computer, then updating it after 6 months of ignoring the reminders.
Kacey_Laine|@daniaustin 😭😭 ah so jealous!
Kacey_Laine|I think my neighbor is practicing music. And it sounds like bagpipes...and they may be playing Celebration. Ross, is that you??? 🙊😱
Kacey_Laine|Dear LA: sometimes you're really pretty and I appreciate that. Keep it up. Sincerely, Kacey http://t.co/rylQnmR7gv
Kacey_Laine|"I try to justify wearing workout clothes every day by saying that Steve Jobs had his ""uniform"". Swap it for a turtleneck- I'm basically him."
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 @glamourista16 LEMME JOIN IN ON THIS LOVE FEST 👯❤️
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday kacey vs. the world 💁
Kacey_Laine|Help. My car is way too hot and it's making my self tanner melt. This is a real life struggle.
Kacey_Laine|@cescadarling safe travels and have fun!!!!! ✈️💁❤️
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen oh I see you 😏 mainly because they're the only notifications I get 💁💃#butactually #weshouldjusthavewalkietalkies
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood I will allow that. As long as I'm second on the list. 🍫👸
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood Oh just wait till you see this. Snapchatting it to you now because it's bad 😂😂
Kacey_Laine|Good news: I'm not sick so I can now leave my bed. Bad news: I was stuck in bed for 3 days so my self tanner now makes me look diseased.
Kacey_Laine|@CarlieStylezz Truer words have never been spoken 🙌 find me a country boy 😍
Kacey_Laine|Waking up to the room spinning... that's fun. Happy Sunday.
Kacey_Laine|It's almost 11am. I just woke up. I guess I was tired?
Kacey_Laine|@cescadarling no 😭😭😭
Kacey_Laine|"""Are you okay? You look pissed."" I'm fine- that's just my face (#RBF) 😐 Apparently Chipotle is now offering counseling along with burritos."
Kacey_Laine|@Michelle_Potter #ShoutoutToSheida 👋 #famewithjosh
Kacey_Laine|"My look today/everyday says: ""I gave up"". There's nothing more confusing than a girl in full hair/makeup, wearing a sweatshirt &amp; Nikes 💁 #me"
Kacey_Laine|Why do I feel that it's necessary to drive 10 minutes out of my way to save $0.30/gallon on gas?
Kacey_Laine|"Remember that time I starred as Goldilocks in ""Goldilocks &amp; the 3 Bears""? 1st grade Kacey was in her prime. Should have put me in pageants 👸"
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan he was old and a dad... Not really my type 😉
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen bring back grocery store cat and we can unleash the two together 🐈👯 #roguecatstakeLA (kinda like Kourtney &amp; Khloe Take Miami).
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen No sightings this week. Last Friday some guy was walking it but then abandoned it. #noloveforparkinglotcat 🐈🙍
Kacey_Laine|I thought some guy was following me. Turns out he lives in the apartment next to me... Oh nice to meet you, neighbor.
Kacey_Laine|Dear man sitting in the parking lot at Panera clipping his toenails: please don't. Sincerely, me.
Kacey_Laine|"My favorite email I received today came from my grandpa with the subject ""WHATS UP"", signed -GPA. I've never called him that in my life."
Kacey_Laine|ACMs gives me all the feels. Like where's my country boy? Why is he not singing me to sleep? 😍😭❤️ (probably because he doesn't exist)
Kacey_Laine|I love when I miss my exit and I'm stuck on the 405 for an extra 30 minutes 💁 #soLA
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo HAHAHAH nothing surprisingly! Just had to get the oil changed.
Kacey_Laine|"Me: ""Uh the wrench light is on. Can you help me?"" Pretty sure the guy changing my oil thinks I'm an idiot. I'm sorry I'm not a real adult."
Kacey_Laine|Gunshots or fireworks? In LA, you never know. This time it was fireworks though...
Kacey_Laine|No time (or desire) to go to the gym? Attempt to french braid your hair while sitting in LA traffic 💁💪 #fitspo #lifehacks #goodideasbykacey
Kacey_Laine|Do you ever wish you were a ballerina so you could wear a tutu all the time? And be invited to MaryKate &amp; Ashley's bday party. No just me? 👯
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves I keep rewatching your snapchat because bebe is so precious and I need to meet her/see you asap. Come to meeeee ❤️❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|Why is there a concert/party/event happening in the parking lot at midnight? Can you please take your speakers/microphone elsewhere? Thanks.
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen I don't know what happened. I'm blaming the pan 😐🚣 #girlspan #wut
Kacey_Laine|So I tried to cook. I now have all my windows open to get the smoke out. And my food isn't even good so I'm having Diet Coke for dinner.
Kacey_Laine|@meghanrosette I fully support this decision.
Kacey_Laine|Wearing the same outfit as a stranger is always cool. But wanna know how to make it even better? Have that stranger be a 70 year old man 👌💁
Kacey_Laine|I saw Adam Levine shirtless tonight. What did you do?
Kacey_Laine|I may have not been able to make it home to celebrate Passover with my family, but I got to see Maroon 5 in concert. Sorry grandma.
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip Come drive home with me on Friday night, and then drive back to LA Sunday night. Aka sorry family I don't wanna be here too long 💁
Kacey_Laine|Do you ever fill in your eyebrows hoping that it'll solve all of your life problems? Yeah no, me neither...
Kacey_Laine|Tonight I discovered my true calling 💁🚣 http://t.co/A2Qt4OECqX
Kacey_Laine|@eileeneveryday Literally me. I just texted my dad...
Kacey_Laine|@glamourista16 I can't think of a better duo, so yes (also come back into my life like ASAP and hang out with me)
Kacey_Laine|I let my hair air dry and now I can't find a hair tie. I'm taking advantage of this moment and auditioning for The Lion King on Broadway 💁😐
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov @ingridnilsen Finances, magic, and chicken- what's not to like? 👨💁 #relatable #typicalchrnov
Kacey_Laine|Why am I still awake when I love sleep so much? Oh yeah, rewatching FRIENDS for the billionth time.
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen I read this as Subway sucks. I was offended on why you'd bash such a basic/quintessential sandwich shop 🙎 subtweets though...🙏
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen like choreographed pageant routines? Or running to the store to buy more rhinestones? Or maybe... performing magic tricks? 👨💁
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov @ingridnilsen that's some positive reinforcement #chickscan 😏 hashtag get it
Kacey_Laine|PSA: don't try out a new self tanner right before a doctors appointment. Not that I've done that before. I just heard from a friend...
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen @chrnov Actually, not sure if it's won any prizes (chrnov, correct me if I'm wrong).
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen @chrnov You could never forget the prize winning chicken.
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen @chrnov You know me too well. I almost replied with the bird and worm 😂 (but at least we got pasta salad snaps last night)
Kacey_Laine|@AllieMarieEvans ME.
Kacey_Laine|Kacey tries to parallel park for 20 minutes then ultimately gives up and pays for parking: a novel by me. Buy it on Amazon in Fall 2015.
Kacey_Laine|I've found my calling. I've mastered the art of bedazzling. Choreographed dance is okay. I'm moving to Vegas. I want to be BSpears.
Kacey_Laine|My thoughts over the last 20 minutes: I'm moving to Nashville. No, I'm moving to Las Vegas. Wait, no- I'm moving to my bed 😴
Kacey_Laine|Built a bookcase today and once again had to use hot glue since the screws didn't work. My bedazzling skills are really coming in handy 👌💁
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen So does mine... oh wait 😏💧 #notthirstyanymore http://t.co/WUx69RPz7x
Kacey_Laine|@carrie_rad Hahahah I love youuuu 😘❤️
Kacey_Laine|When the guy at Chipotle winks and doesn't charge for guac... thanks so much, but I love the burrito more than I'll ever love a human 💁😐
Kacey_Laine|"At Michael's and some dad says, ""Whoa, LOOK! They have science kits!"" To which his kid responds: ""They also have GLITTER!"" She is me 💁✨"
Kacey_Laine|It's almost midnight and I've been watching @mcuban interviews for the last 4 hours. Normal Friday night.
Kacey_Laine|Most people save screenshots of texts they receive. My phone is full of screenshots of texts I've sent... because I'm really funny 😐💁
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes when you're building furniture you have to use a glue gun to hold a screw in place. (They teach you that in building school. Duh)
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood It kept running away from me 🙍
Kacey_Laine|Today I found a cat in the parking lot 💁🐈 http://t.co/A175hVCZwT
Kacey_Laine|I just got the urge to do something drastic with my hair. Like cut it. Or go blonde. Or wear a ponytail for the 5th day in a row.
Kacey_Laine|Ha remember that time when I went to some random house thinking it was a flower shop and it turned out it wasn't... #TBT to this morning 💁
Kacey_Laine|I was about to go to sleep and then my Apple TV broke. How am I supposed to fall asleep without Netflix? 😭
Kacey_Laine|@Michelle_Potter Ask Jordan for the name of the funeral florist.
Kacey_Laine|I was just thinking about the time when the cruise director wouldn’t let me wear my life vest to the safety meeting. That was rude.
Kacey_Laine|I really really really really really really like you. And by you, I mean my bed. And Netflix 😘💁 #subtweet
Kacey_Laine|It's 8pm. That's an acceptable time to go to sleep, right? (Actually I don't really care about the answer...😴😴😴)
Kacey_Laine|I realized that I don't listen to full playlists anymore. I'll listen to one song. On repeat. All day. Today: Shania Twain.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo stop being so pretty please and thank you.
Kacey_Laine|@lily_marston I'm not sure... I want one like from the fair. But I don't think it's state fair season 😭🎠
Kacey_Laine|I'm laying in bed and I don't think I can get up. But I still have my makeup on. And I really want a churro. Serious struggles here.
Kacey_Laine|I'm wearing a sweatshirt and lululemon pants, hoping that I look like a basic college girl and not someone who just gave up. Happy Monday 💁
Kacey_Laine|We were supposed to turn our clocks forward today. I didn't have to because I never set mine correctly last time...
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen @eileeneveryday 💁 #girlscan
Kacey_Laine|"Things I hear outside my apartment building at 11:30pm on a Saturday: ""Wait, are you the Uber? YASSSS"""
Kacey_Laine|I wish I could explain my last tweet. But I can't. So... 🚣
Kacey_Laine|My Netflix was playing in Spanish and I sat there for 5 minutes before having a mini breakdown because I thought my brain stopped working.
Kacey_Laine|I was going to leave my apartment to get food. Then I got an email that the elevator is broken. Delivery sounds like a good idea...
Kacey_Laine|@ingridnilsen @chrnov while eating chicken and pasta salad...duh 👨💁 (#typicalchrnov emojis)
Kacey_Laine|Can I call an Uber to drive me from my parking spot directly to my apartment door? Or maybe have Postmates deliver...me?
Kacey_Laine|@AprilLockhart MY FAVORITE 😍😭
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood 🙌🙌🙌
Kacey_Laine|I've decided I'm only communicating with my friends via audio messages.
Kacey_Laine|Apparently it's supposed to rain for the next two days. I'm so glad I got my car washed yesterday.
Kacey_Laine|Why am I still awake right now? I don't know. But watching FRIENDS at 4am sounds like a great idea.
Kacey_Laine|#manbunwatch2k15
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo yes. Is that not a normal question?
Kacey_Laine|“@michellexxo: So excited to see @andygrammer tonight and to finally be reunited with @Kacey_Laine! 😍🎉” YES 👯 #llamawatch2k15
Kacey_Laine|Someone needs to teach me how to use my car so I don't have to spend so much time here. #livetweetfromtheautoshop #again 🚙🔫
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov @heyingridnilsen @MaxPolisar chrnov you're wrong. It's blue
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo @abc15 #llamawatch
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I'm still locked on the llamas...
Kacey_Laine|I spend way too much time in my car. Not because I'm in traffic (partly true) but because I'll sit in the parking lot, too lazy to walk 😐💁
Kacey_Laine|@lawwwraah Like country Ed Sheeran. I'm dying/falling deeply in love 😭😍
Kacey_Laine|@lawwwraah Wait. Recently found his music. Obsessed 😍
Kacey_Laine|Ed Sheeran cover of Dirrty? Yes please 😍 Like this needs to be a regular thing in life.
Kacey_Laine|I think I just heard thunder...and my first instinct is to check Twitter to see if that's what it was. LA, were you thunder-ing?
Kacey_Laine|Apparently it rained in LA today. I didn't know this until I walked into my living room and my floor was wet because my windows were open.
Kacey_Laine|"I'm looking at my grocery list and on it I have ""quesadilla mix""... I think that I mean tortillas and cheese."
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood this is why I love you 😍😂 and yes. May have listened to that song 20 times today...or more.
Kacey_Laine|I've been listening to Eminem circa 2000 all day today. I have no explanation. Happy Friday.
Kacey_Laine|I'm home. Just kidding, I'm back at the auto shop (basically home) 😐🚙 #livetweetfromtheautoshop
Kacey_Laine|I feel like I need a more aggressive car horn sound. I don't think mine accurately expresses how I feel...
Kacey_Laine|@glamourista16 I MISS YOU 😭❤️ come back to me asap
Kacey_Laine|"Looking through my bank statements for taxes is really depressing. ""Do you think Chipotle counts as a deduction for business expenses?"" 💁"
Kacey_Laine|"Chris Harrison is my favorite. ""Do you realize that you're crazy and everyone hates you?"" - may not be an exact quote, but basically 💁"
Kacey_Laine|LA- why are you so hot? It's February. I want to wear sweat pants and fuzzy socks.
Kacey_Laine|An old lady at the grocery store just asked me if the hummus I was buying was good. I said yes. I'd like to think I changed her life.
Kacey_Laine|@SkylarDayne nooo we just missed each other 😭😭
Kacey_Laine|In New York, at a coffee shop. I am living my dream of being in FRIENDS. Minus the actual friends part. Minor detail.
Kacey_Laine|The Longest Ride Trailer. Scott Eastwood. He's a cowboy. Yes please 😍😍
Kacey_Laine|@missbarbiegal19 AH wait that's so weird/cool/I feel like that means I need to get it...
Kacey_Laine|Was told that my college email was deleted. Does that mean I can't use it for student discounts anymore? Should I not be doing that anyways?
Kacey_Laine|Someone was riding a personal Segway at the airport. Why isn't that me? #dreambig
Kacey_Laine|While everyone else is at Playlist or the Grammys, I'm sitting in bed eating Chipotle and watching FRIENDS. So I win 💁
Kacey_Laine|I'm glad this was a successful trip. Obviously I'm really good at being an adult. #livetweetfromtheautoshop #tobecontinued
Kacey_Laine|I've been here for an hour and a half and I'm tired so I told them I'd come back in two weeks to get it fixed. #livetweetfromtheautoshop
Kacey_Laine|"They asked if I had plans tonight. ""I put pants on so I could come here. Is that not impressive enough?"" #livetweetfromtheautoshop"
Kacey_Laine|"Couple next to me: ""We're in love, we're like glue. Gorilla glue. Actually maybe Elmer's glue..."" 💏 #truelove #livetweetfromtheautoshop"
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz I definitely considered that. But they just started with my car and at least this is good entertainment 😂😂
Kacey_Laine|"This man is now standing directly in front of the TV loudly reacting to the show- ""LOOK AT THAT!"" #canyounot #livetweetfromtheautoshop"
Kacey_Laine|Yes I am that girl that knows nothing about cars. This is why I need guy friends (or just friends in general...) #livetweetfromtheautoshop
Kacey_Laine|"Me trying to explain the issue... ""Uh the AC is broken. Like it used to work, and now it doesn't. I'm too hot now"" #livetweetfromtheautoshop"
Kacey_Laine|Live tweeting from the auto shop (aka my favorite place in the world) 😐🔫🚙 #kaceytriestobeareallifeadult
Kacey_Laine|Rescheduling my appt to a time when the only person who can help is on lunch makes so much sense. Obvies that's how you run a business 😐
Kacey_Laine|I was reunited with @DaniAustin2 tonight and we're 76% sure we saw an actual shooting star... 🌟💫
Kacey_Laine|12am thoughts. Let's move the TV and put it in my bedroom. That sounds like a good idea. At midnight. When I have work at 8. Yes. Good work.
Kacey_Laine|"""I might wash my hair."" - Britt is me."
Kacey_Laine|"""Sorry, commercial is over and The Bachelor is back on. I'll talk to you later"" - an actual statement from me. I wish I was kidding."
Kacey_Laine|Not even 3 minutes into the episode and this girl thinks they are going out of the country... to New Mexico. I see the effort 😐 #TheBachelor
Kacey_Laine|Because it's not official until it's said on Twitter. HAPPY BIRTHDAY @heyingridnilsen 💁 #kthxxxbyeeeeeee
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo SHUT UP WHY AM I NOT WITH YOU
Kacey_Laine|I've been watching America's Book of Secrets for the last 6 hours, so I think we all know the real winner of today.
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter ...what's football?
Kacey_Laine|Apparently it's Super Bowl day... I'm on my couch watching America's Book of Secrets on Netflix. I have no plans to change it 🇺🇸 #America
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes in my spare time I like to look on Postmates. Not because I'm hungry but just to see what's available 💁 #dreambig
Kacey_Laine|This is my Saturday night... I wish I had an explanation. http://t.co/yxCXu3kfN9
Kacey_Laine|2:30am sounds like a great time to... 😴😴
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan @DaniAustin2 Miss you pretty girl &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@AllieMarieEvans yesss 😍😍 four months from now reunion? (But really though it better be way sooner)
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo HANG OUT WITH ME.
Kacey_Laine|Remember that time I really didn't want to get ready so I wore a sweatshirt and my glasses? #TBT oh wait, no... that's me right now 😐
Kacey_Laine|@MarissaLace can we find a hobby aside from work? 👯👯
Kacey_Laine|@MarissaLace I have hummus 🙌
Kacey_Laine|I need a hobby. And friends. And a life. And more hummus. I don't know. Late night thoughts.
Kacey_Laine|"""Who's the idiot who can't park their car straight inside the lines?"" - oh wait... that's me 😐 #oops"
Kacey_Laine|I decided to get food on my way home and now I missed the first 20 minutes of The Bachelor. Worst night ever 😭😭 (over exaggeration? Maybe)
Kacey_Laine|Why am I not on The Celebrity Apprentice? Because I'm not a celebrity. And I'd rather be on Shark Tank (sign me up @mcuban) 🐋
Kacey_Laine|When Trivia Crack gives you all really easy questions... I promise I'm not usually this smart. But I'll take it.
Kacey_Laine|Dear car horn outside that keeps beeping. Please stop. You're distracting me from my Netflix watching. Please and thank you.
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov #typicalchrnov @heyingridnilsen
Kacey_Laine|"On the phone with my bank's fraud protection- ""You have another purchase at Chipotle""... yeah that's probably true."
Kacey_Laine|Why am I not asleep right now? Like actually though, if you know the answer- let me know 😐😴
Kacey_Laine|Who votes that @chrisbharrison crash my viewing party for #TheBachelor? Quick question though, does watching by myself count as a party? 😐🎉
Kacey_Laine|“@Lenaturnsgreen: @Kacey_Laine with good eyebrows you don't need pants.” 🙌 SO TRUE
Kacey_Laine|Like this is a huge internal conflict. What's more important to me- no pants Monday or good eyebrows? #thestruggleisreal
Kacey_Laine|I have 3 hours until my eyebrow appointment and I'm debating canceling it because I don't want to put on clothes.
Kacey_Laine|You know when you're on your phone while watching TV and you are drifting off but still following all the story.  😐 weird. Sleepy time 🐒
Kacey_Laine|"Walking from my car to my building and having some guy yell, ""hey girlllll, where you going?"" I guess I'm back in LA 😐 #backoffplease"
Kacey_Laine|The internet can take me to a dark place. Mainly when it decides to show me pictures of Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth and I start crying 😭💔
Kacey_Laine|I'm really upset. Got @panerabread to go and came home to find they forgot my brownie 😭😭😭
Kacey_Laine|Red Bull before 8am. You're not allowed to judge.
Kacey_Laine|Help. I'm trying to participate in normal human life and can't. How do I find an eye doctor in LA that doesn't seem super sketchy...
Kacey_Laine|"Postmates texted to say my food would be ready in 15 minutes. Do I reply ""thanks bff. luv u 😻"" or is that coming on too strong?"
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy ah it may have been delivered when I was away!! My mail people can be annoying 🙈
Kacey_Laine|"@michellexxo is it sad I read ""virtual workout classes"" and thought that meant I wouldn't have to get up and actually move to do them..."
Kacey_Laine|I may be the girl who cried wolf. Or I may be the old lady in the LifeAlert commercial...you never know. http://t.co/cJXD5TZKMw
Kacey_Laine|Does someone want to come and take my makeup off for me? Also, if you could put me in my bed, that'd be great. K thx bye 😴😴
Kacey_Laine|@MarissaLace literally me 🙌 sorry we're just so funny 💁
Kacey_Laine|"""I will not shoot any of you"" - quoted from this season of The Bachelor. Good to know 😐"
Kacey_Laine|"""My boss was like, you need to apply for The Bachelor"" -- I hope I never get to that point in life..."
Kacey_Laine|"Her awkward laugh after, ""Okay another weird question. Ha"" 😐 Okay yeah that's a weird question. #TheBachelor"
Kacey_Laine|Tonight is #TheBachelor. So basically I'm unreachable. Unless I'm giving you a live rundown of the show/my reactions. In which case, sorry 💁
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves AHHH COME SEE ME!!!
Kacey_Laine|@hellokaty my dad has a group chat with me and my sister to say goodnight too 😂😂
Kacey_Laine|Jared Leto's braid looks better than mine ever will.
Kacey_Laine|Just when I thought me and the delivery guy had a good thing going, they go and change my favorite thing on the menu. Trust no one 😭😭😭
Kacey_Laine|My only problem with getting food delivered is that I have to put pants on to answer the door...
Kacey_Laine|Driving in the rain while listening to Britney Spears, 'Stronger' (aka only goal of 6 year old me). Give me a chair and I'll do the dance 💁
Kacey_Laine|Why am I not Britney Spears?
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I really think your car is cursed!!!
Kacey_Laine|I drove in silence for 10 minutes because I didn't realize I hadn't turned my music on. It's been a long day.
Kacey_Laine|@MakeupbyMandy24 AHHH 😍 Obsessed.
Kacey_Laine|I'm 3 blocks from my apartment yet I've been stuck in traffic for the last 15 minutes. LA traffic, why are you a thing? Please stop.
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov 👨💁 #typicalchrnov @heyingridnilsen
Kacey_Laine|I have to be up in 6 hours. But I'm watching last night's episode of the Bachelor. So like... #kaceymakesgooddecisions #thebachelor
Kacey_Laine|Bring me NyQuil and I'll love you forever 😍
Kacey_Laine|Back to basics. Shoutout to Christina Aguilera circa 2006. http://t.co/9FTIf5XQTF
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood hahah yes of course!! I'm going to sleep now as well 😘😴
Kacey_Laine|The Bachelor comes back tomorrow and I don't know who's more excited: me, or all of you guys who get to read my reaction tweets 😏🌹
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood Oooh tell me more 😏😏
Kacey_Laine|@MsBrittanybrat me 🙌
Kacey_Laine|Getting my car wash seemed like a good idea. Until I waited till 5:30pm to get it done. It's dark in here and I'm scared 😥
Kacey_Laine|I was going to actually get stuff done today. Then I started watching House of Cards...
Kacey_Laine|Cons of FRIENDS being on Netflix? Now I spend all night thinking about how perfect Ross and Rachel are and how unbelievably single I am.
Kacey_Laine|It's 10pm. I've spent all day watching Netflix, yet for some reason I feel it's the right time to call and try to upgrade my TV cable plan.
Kacey_Laine|It's somewhat cold in LA so naturally I'm online looking for winter coats...
Kacey_Laine|The sunset is at an angle where it forced me to move a foot over from my spot on my bed so I can see my computer 😐 #thestruggleisreal
Kacey_Laine|While everyone else is worried about writing 2014 instead of 2015, I'm over here still writing October... oops 😐
Kacey_Laine|@MarissaLace ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|Is Chipotle open today? Asking for a friend...
Kacey_Laine|Also, FRIENDS is now on Netflix. I know my plans for today 😍🙌
Kacey_Laine|First tweet of 2015 💃🎉
Kacey_Laine|If I don't sing karaoke with Zac Efron tonight, I'm gunna be upset. That's my only dream (expectation) in life.
Kacey_Laine|Getting ready for tonight by listening to Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears 💃🎉 #partylikeits1999 #kiddingiwas5
Kacey_Laine|But like, do I actually have to get ready and see people tonight? Or can I get away with just laying in bed and watching Netflix?
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Def had the yes to juicy ones...
Kacey_Laine|I JUST FIXED THE ZIPPER ON ONE OF MY SWEATSHIRTS 🙌 2015 will be a great year #doingbigthings
Kacey_Laine|Yes, I've had the same song on repeat for the last 3 hours. Yes, it is 'Lucky' by Britney Spears. Apologies to my neighbors (not really) 💁🎤
Kacey_Laine|Answer: yes, LA decided to rain. And guess who forgot to close her windows once again? ✌️😐☔️ #kaceydiscoversrain part 3
Kacey_Laine|LA ARE YOU GUNNA RAIN?!? ☔️
Kacey_Laine|Mailman. Why do you come here so late? It's 10:45pm and you just rang my doorbell requiring me to wake up and answer it. No. Not okay.
Kacey_Laine|@cicilyboone Mine had tassles 😂 and it was like various shades of pink yarn. Ahhh gotta love it.
Kacey_Laine|Side note- in 4th grade, I had my mom knit me a poncho because I thought I was really cool. It was pink... it was not cool.
Kacey_Laine|I'm looking at ponchos and considering buying one. Like actually though. I have no idea why. Someone please take my computer away from me.
Kacey_Laine|I would say the no pants thing is a perk of living alone. But I just don't like wearing pants. It'd be a thing even if I lived with people.
Kacey_Laine|It's getting cold in LA. The only reason I recognize this is because I'm still wearing pants. And normally it's a no-pants-household.
Kacey_Laine|@ardenrose186 Loved this and love you my darling!! Congrats!!! 😘❤️
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves AHHH I have to see you and bebe!!!
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves @meghanrosette WHEN WILL YOU BE IN LA?!?!?
Kacey_Laine|@MarissaLace THEY DO THAT TO ME EVERYTIME!!!! Sorry I'm so fabulous.
Kacey_Laine|Why have I been awake since 6am? I don't know. But it's a real thing.
Kacey_Laine|Chuck and Blair are perfect. End of story 😭❤️
Kacey_Laine|Remind me to never drive back to LA on the Sunday after Christmas. 7 hours later, I'm finally home 😐🙌
Kacey_Laine|This is why I hate driving this during the day. Still have 3 hours until I make it to LA (praying there's no traffic) 😂🔫
Kacey_Laine|11:30am at a family restaurant for my grandpa's 86th birthday and they bring out a tequila shot. Okay.
Kacey_Laine|Breakfast on a Sunday morning sounds like a good idea. Until you try to fit 9 people in a restaurant.
Kacey_Laine|It's been an hour and I've made no progress in packing. Actually, that's a lie. I'm now watching HGTV from my room instead of the couch.
Kacey_Laine|I'm leaving to go back to LA tomorrow. I never unpacked at home, so that should make packing a lot easier.
Kacey_Laine|"Tiny House Hunters is my new favorite thing. ""My house has to be under 150 square feet, but it NEEDS to have a front porch."" Okay 😐🏠"
Kacey_Laine|@OhhMyAnnie @DazzleMeHay YES YES YES 🎉💃 girls night!!
Kacey_Laine|I'll be in LA for NYE. Boys- you know where to find me (probably in my apartment all alone... 💋🎉😐)
Kacey_Laine|What do I do when I'm home for the holidays? Watch endless HGTV. That's all.
Kacey_Laine|It's not even 8:30pm and I'm about 5 minutes from falling asleep 😴😴
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu me every night. Then I realize that I can just brush my teeth again.
Kacey_Laine|Much of our Christmas was spent watching Matty B videos and having my cousin ask, do you know him? Yes. We're bffs.
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood Hahaha he used to ask if I had a boyfriend. Now it's gotten to just asking if I have friends... 😂😂
Kacey_Laine|"""Do you have any social life?"" - Grandpa getting straight to the point and asking the important questions (answer: ha no)"
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo LOVE ME 😭 and I wanna go 😍
Kacey_Laine|All I want for Christmas is infinite Olive Garden 😍🍝 (ignore the fact that I'm Jewish)
Kacey_Laine|"""We have no kitchen. I can't make cookies. How am I supposed to get in the holiday spirit? This home doesn't work."" - actual quote from me."
Kacey_Laine|I'm currently trapped in my room because there are construction workers at my house and I don't want to put on pants or a bra #struggles
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I could never!!! 💗
Kacey_Laine|The Serial sketch on SNL 😂👌
Kacey_Laine|Guess who has to go to the Apple store tomorrow 😐 I swear if my computer dies, I may cry. Like no. Don't. Please.
Kacey_Laine|I've been home for 3 days and have yet to get mexican food. Pretty sure that's the only reason I'm still here. Sorry friends #ilikefood
Kacey_Laine|I'm sitting on my living room floor, eating Chinese food straight from the box, while watching the Food Network. Happy holidays from home.
Kacey_Laine|I'm home and we have no kitchen or dining room. And everything is packed into the living room...uh dad- how am I supposed to get food? 😐
Kacey_Laine|@iwillderive Late last night? Highly possible. Hahah road trips require an In N Out stop 😂
Kacey_Laine|After literally the longest drive of my entire life- thanks nighttime construction, love you too- I'm finally home 🙌😴
Kacey_Laine|Bye LA. See you in 2015 ✌️
Kacey_Laine|Starting the morning w/ Diet Coke. Mainly because I'm driving 6 hours immediately after work today. Also because I want to. Don't judge me.
Kacey_Laine|"I think my talents have gone from ""can bedazzle anything"" to ""will bedazzle anything"". Someone take away the rhinestones 😐✨"
Kacey_Laine|"So where on my resume would ""Can bedazzle anything"" go? Like before or after ""Flawless pageant walk""..."
Kacey_Laine|It's the first night of Channukah and I'm in LA, all alone, with no menorah. Can I light a Bath &amp; Body Works candle instead?
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo dude I miss you way too much. Come back into my life (cue Vanessa Hudgens Baby Come Back 😭💔)
Kacey_Laine|I go to Party City way more than the average person. Especially considering the fact that I never hang out with people. Ever 😐🎉 #partyof1
Kacey_Laine|FALSE ALARM. Computer works. Thanks @Oprah 🙌 (for the emotional support through this difficult time...she did nothing to actually help)
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves LITERALLY ME.
Kacey_Laine|Ummm so, computer. Can you please work? Like, maybe don't do that thing where you shut off and say there's no wifi installed...thx 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|I just got really sad thinking about Lizzie McGuire. And why have I never been mistaken for an international pop star 😭💔
Kacey_Laine|I'm not honking my horn because I have road rage. It's because people are stupid 😐🚙 #literallystop
Kacey_Laine|Apparently I'm an artist after 9:30 🎨☔️🐥 http://t.co/km8TmVMinU
Kacey_Laine|Why was I not invited to TSwift's birthday? I thought we were best friends. Whatever, I'll hang out with Justin Timberlake another day.
Kacey_Laine|Send help. I need someone to carry me from my car to my apartment. I'm too tired. Please and thank you.
Kacey_Laine|Also I sleep with my windows open so I woke up to a soaked floor 😐🔫☔️ #kaceydiscoversrain
Kacey_Laine|Yes, I am currently wearing my competition warm-ups from my gymnastics days because I don't own hooded jackets 😐☔️ #kaceydiscoversrain
Kacey_Laine|"""It doesn't rain in LA""- me as I try to leave my apartment building. No that's not a lake. http://t.co/v320NaedeF"
Kacey_Laine|“@MarissaLace: Surprise me with Starbucks so I know it's real” 🙌😍
Kacey_Laine|I haven't tweeted since Sunday. And I don't know if this would even count as a tweet. Like I'm falling asleep while typing this 😴
Kacey_Laine|I got a parking ticket. Happy Sunday to you too.
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz ah love!!
Kacey_Laine|Thank jesus 🙌 http://t.co/6k0M3mUPVb
Kacey_Laine|@MarissaLace @lexielombard I'm dying 😂😂
Kacey_Laine|My phone keeps buzzing but I can't find it. Probably because I'm not looking for it....
Kacey_Laine|"Complete the look with a full face of makeup and workout pants. This adds to your mysteriousness. ""Did she work out? Probably not."" 💁"
Kacey_Laine|The key to pulling off this look is to wear a college sweatshirt for a school you got rejected from. Today's school is UCLA #dreambig 💙💛
Kacey_Laine|"I call today's look: ""it's raining in LA and I'm tired so I'm going to pretend to be a college student &amp; not get dressed in real clothes"" 💁"
Kacey_Laine|Currently googling pictures of Disneyland during the holidays. I wanna gooooooo 😍😭
Kacey_Laine|@heyingridnilsen @chrnov 👨
Kacey_Laine|@chrnov @heyingridnilsen it was the highlight of my night.
Kacey_Laine|Thank you Oprah (and the kind people at the Apple Store), I now have a new phone that actually works 🙌
Kacey_Laine|My phone is actually broken. Please send your prayers 📱🙏
Kacey_Laine|Alright, too much feelings. I'm done. I just wanted to say hi and I love you and it can get better (last cheese sesh, I promise) ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|&amp; I realize that's a weird way to word it. It's hard to admit bc I don't want to jinx it, but this is the closest I've been for a long time.
Kacey_Laine|I hate getting all cheesy and junk, and I don't even know exactly what I want to say- but I think I'm happy...
Kacey_Laine|I don't think of this as 6 hours being trapped in a car. It's 6 hours spent perfecting my Britney Spears impersonation.
Kacey_Laine|LA, I'm coming for ya 😘
Kacey_Laine|Elsa is at this birthday party. She's doing magic. http://t.co/99qXDuFLxe
Kacey_Laine|I forgot how much I love waking up to the sound of rain. Okay, I guess I miss you norcal 😥💔☔️
Kacey_Laine|I'll pay someone (in friendship) to pack for me. I've been living out of my suitcase for a week and it's a mess (like my life). Please help.
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves sending my best friend big birthday wishes!!! And sending lots of love and hugs to the rest of the fam ❤️❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|T-2 hours till Black Friday shopping adventure begins. Nap time then Diet Coke 😍🇺🇸 #iloveamerica
Kacey_Laine|I'm thankful for you ❤️ http://t.co/EtQOwN2IBD
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz hahaha technology from the 90s is super reliable...except not at all. Hahah
Kacey_Laine|@briannadeg I'm guessing the date on the camera was wrong. Hahaha gotta love technology from the 90s 😂
Kacey_Laine|"I found a picture from the day I was ""born"" and the date on it shows 7/28/94. I thought I was born on the 29th...I've been living a lie 😐"
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip @chrnov @heyingridnilsen #snapchatplayground
Kacey_Laine|Reasons I love being back home: it only takes 10 minutes to get all the way across town. Yay for no traffic 😍
Kacey_Laine|@MakeupbyMandy24 Literally my life ✌️
Kacey_Laine|Kacey's cross California road trip adventure begins now. My life for the next 6 hours will consist of Diet Coke and BSpears circa 1999 😍🚙
Kacey_Laine|Hi turbulence. You're not annoying at all. Especially when I'm trying to work and can't read my computer ✈️😐
Kacey_Laine|Goodbye New Jersey. LA, please have Diet Coke ready for me- it's gunna be a long day ✈️😴
Kacey_Laine|Once again, airport security has to check my hair. I guess it's suspicious to have fabulous hair 💁
Kacey_Laine|I'm like a huge fan of Shark Tank...but why are they there? And what is Daymond wearing? #AMAs2014
Kacey_Laine|Wait. I wanna be best friends with Taylor Swift. Like why is that not a thing?
Kacey_Laine|My goal is to be in bed by 8pm #playlistlive #iknowimapartyanimal
Kacey_Laine|We are playing directions from Waze because this Uber driver actually has no idea where he's going. I feel so safe 😐
Kacey_Laine|"I like how my ""I hate people"" attitude is accepted/normal here. New York, you're not too bad 💁"
Kacey_Laine|Like he just suggested it again. No thanks, we don't want to go to 7-11.
Kacey_Laine|Our Uber driver wants to take us to 7-11...
Kacey_Laine|The Friends finale is on TV. Aka the only reason I'm semi okay with this flight.
Kacey_Laine|"My look today is called ""Ratchet California girl is going to the east coast and isn't prepared for the cold- Day 1"" 💁"
Kacey_Laine|So sleep...is that a real thing that people actually need?
Kacey_Laine|The fact that I'm leaving tomorrow, have yet to pack, and still have a ton of stuff to do tonight...yeahhh great idea, Kacey 😐 #teamnosleep
Kacey_Laine|I am Britney Spears circa 2007.
Kacey_Laine|Is it bedtime yet? 😴😴😴
Kacey_Laine|Swapped my morning Starbucks for a Diet Coke. Stop judging me 😐💁
Kacey_Laine|It's too early to be awake. And I'm saying this after I've been up for over an hour 😴😴
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes I think sleep is a waste of time...but like also, I really like to sleep. So it's a big struggle 😐😴
Kacey_Laine|Ha. Wait. They're fireworks. I'm really smart 😐
Kacey_Laine|Dear car/motorcycle/whatever you are outside that is very very loud. Shut up. Please and thank you.
Kacey_Laine|Choosing to go to the Grove today was pretty much the same as choosing death.
Kacey_Laine|Yes Kacey, let's buy 4 pairs of black pants. You need more 😐 #ineverevenwearpants
Kacey_Laine|It's 9pm and I'm literally about to fall asleep while writing this. So done 😴😴😴😴
Kacey_Laine|Just had a near death experience. Aka got trapped in my sweatshirt. But I'm alive #blessed #literallyonlyme #strugglesoflivingalone 😐
Kacey_Laine|I just saw a little girl cruising around on a scooter wearing a reflective neon vest. So much yes #mynewbestfriend #safetyfirst 👯
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan hahahah I def feel like I have 😂😂 miss you!! ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|"""People suck"" - my motto for today. And life 😐🔫"
Kacey_Laine|I really should be asleep. But it's so much more fun to be awake. Talk to me, friends. Ha wait- what friends? 😂😐
Kacey_Laine|Someone help. I'm trapped in my car in the parking lot since I don't wanna walk to my apartment (because of the rain) #soLA #ihatemetoo 😐☔️
Kacey_Laine|"The only thing making this bumper to bumper traffic semi-bearable is listening to TSwift ""Blank Space"" on repeat 😍🙏"
Kacey_Laine|Is my hair still in the same bun as yesterday? Why yes, so nice of you to notice 😐 #longhairdontcare #apologiesforthathashtag
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip 😏😘🇺🇸
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip ...not even on Columbus Day? Or 4th of July? #somuchloveforamerica
Kacey_Laine|Attention: I made it back to Starbucks Gold level- I'd like to thank the wonderful staff at Sbux for their support. And of course, Oprah 🙏❤️
Kacey_Laine|Random TSA pre-check? Okay. I'm not complaining.
Kacey_Laine|Our Uber driver is in a silver Toyota. I feel like that's not a proper Uber car. It feels very flashback to school carpool days #nothanks 💁😐
Kacey_Laine|@ryancharch HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! Hope you have a fabulous day and I'll see you so soon!!! 😘🎉
Kacey_Laine|@thecomet ahhh I'm 1 point away!!!!
Kacey_Laine|😐🔫 literally me when they told me I had to replace my back two tires. One week after I replaced my front two tires. Sweet.
Kacey_Laine|"""I wanna stay here. This place is amazing"" -quoted by one of the little kids playing here. At the tire shop."
Kacey_Laine|Watching this dad play with his kids at the tire shop is adorable. Like I'm dying at how precious they are 😍😍
Kacey_Laine|All of these road closures are really not working for me. Let's hope my car can make it to the tire shop 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|Like I actually think my car hates me. Or the people at the tire store loved me and wanted me back asap 😐🔫 either way, I'm not stoked.
Kacey_Laine|“@MarissaLace: If you're ever wondering how a girl is feeling just check her tumblr” 🙌
Kacey_Laine|@kenzziemichelle hahahah I so wanted to. But I didn't know if that'd be super creepy 😁😂
Kacey_Laine|There's a 3 year old at Starbucks wearing legit the exact same outfit as me. Complete with a chambray shirt, leggings, and top knot.
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood Ah yayyyyyy ❤️
Kacey_Laine|Less than 2 minutes until TSwift tickets go on sale. Wish me luck.
Kacey_Laine|"Whoa major throwback to 2004. Someone's playing Eminem's ""Mockingbird"" right outside the window. I'm kinda alright with it."
Kacey_Laine|Hi computer. It'd be really great if you could maybe not freeze up and die while I'm working. Thanks 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|The problem with being up early and trying to be productive, is that no one else is awake. Y'all need to wake up when I do. Thanks.
Kacey_Laine|@kayleymelissa LOVE.
Kacey_Laine|@cescadarling 🙌 my life
Kacey_Laine|Waze is making me want to die. No I can't turn left across that street. Please just take me home.
Kacey_Laine|@macup101 literally you're flawless. Miss you pretty girl 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|John Mayer in the morning. Yes please 😍😍
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan love you darling!! ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|I look so basic today. It's kinda embarrassing but also like whatever 💁😐
Kacey_Laine|@ellefowler sending so much love and positive vibes your way ❤️❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|This almost looks like fall. Happy November, LA 😐🍃 http://t.co/kf7EQbex7w
Kacey_Laine|"""The sky's awake, so I'm awake!""- me after daylight savings 🌞"
Kacey_Laine|Why am I still getting emails from my college inviting me to career workshops? #iknowyoumissme
Kacey_Laine|@carrie_rad literally me 😂
Kacey_Laine|Wish me luck as I embark on the journey of attempting to buy new tires. Again. For the second time. In a week 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|We get an extra hour of sleep tonight. Thank you Oprah 🙌 [pretty sure she's the one who organized it...right?]
Kacey_Laine|It's 64 degrees in LA and I'm freezing 😐❄️
Kacey_Laine|I'm only kinda sorry 😐 #basic #butwhatever http://t.co/2kXI0zSaZH
Kacey_Laine|I fell asleep while doing my makeup...that's new 😐😴 #bedtimeplease
Kacey_Laine|I got trapped in my car in the parking lot because it's raining and I live in LA #whatsrain 😐☔️
Kacey_Laine|Getting semi-ready today was like the worst thing ever. Like I was soooo not feeling it at all.
Kacey_Laine|What am I for Halloween? Ratchet. Not so much a costume, more just my state of appearance since it's Friday and I'm tired.
Kacey_Laine|I've been laying on the floor for the last hour because I'm too tired to move to my bed. Help, I've fallen (asleep) and I can't get up.
Kacey_Laine|Stuck in Love. One of the best movies on Netflix/in life 😍
Kacey_Laine|Good morning world, so nice to see you. Ha jk I'm the only one awake.
Kacey_Laine|@sarah_z817 my exact thoughts 🙌
Kacey_Laine|I have to be at work at 6:15 tomorrow morning. How early is too early for a Diet Coke? #askingforafriend
Kacey_Laine|Happy birthday mommy. I love you and miss you, forever and always ♡
Kacey_Laine|@heyingridnilsen I'm already planning for Halloween 2015 💁
Kacey_Laine|I just tried to stand up but my leg went numb and I ended up on my floor for 5 minutes cuz I couldn't move. I feel like that's not normal...
Kacey_Laine|So Halloween is in 3 days and I still have no costume...can I just be myself? Aka no pants and binge-watching Netflix all alone 💁
Kacey_Laine|"If you ever want to make me look straight up stupid, take me to a car/tire place- ""Hi, I need my car to work"" 😐🚙"
Kacey_Laine|It's 6:30am and I'm all ready for the day...when's bedtime? 😴
Kacey_Laine|@heyingridnilsen It's actually all a joke. We're really going back to 1999 #surprise #bringbackbspears #hitmebabyonemoretime
Kacey_Laine|Dear car, I thought we were buddies. Can you like not have your tire pressure light go off every 3 weeks? Thanks.
Kacey_Laine|Someone remind me that I have to pay my parking ticket tomorrow. I've put a note in my calendar but I feel like I need more motivation 😐
Kacey_Laine|Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream.
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy Yes please 💗
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo ps. miss your face like way too much and you need to come back in my life. like right now.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo @SamHuntMusic RIGHT?!? Like I'm in love 😍😍
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy ...ended up learning so much more by actually going out there and working, than I would have ever learned in a classroom.
Kacey_Laine|"@hollysaysheyy Honestly for me, it just wasn't the right thing at the time. I wasn't taking advantage of the ""college experience"" and I've"
Kacey_Laine|1989 by my girl TSwift is out. And so is Montevallo by my love @SamHuntMusic. So like, music is real good right now 😍
Kacey_Laine|And there are still times when I doubt what I'm doing &amp; wonder if I made a mistake. But I have to remember, everything happens for a reason.
Kacey_Laine|Today marks the day that two years ago I withdrew from college. It was the hardest decisions I've ever made, but I think it worked out okay.
Kacey_Laine|It's almost dark out which means it's almost nighttime which means I can go to sleep now...right?
Kacey_Laine|Trying to find parking. In LA. On a Sunday 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|@emilyjune_ @aspynovard IM DYING 😂😂😂
Kacey_Laine|I always read tweets like they're texts from my friends. Then I have to realize that TSwift was not texting me. And I do not have friends.
Kacey_Laine|“@taylorswift13: 24 HOURS TIL 1989” AHHH IM DYING. LIKE DEAD 😍🎉🙏
Kacey_Laine|I've fallen for the trap that is Pinterest. Guess that's gunna be my Saturday night...#noshame
Kacey_Laine|Help. My water has been off for the past 5 hours. @LADWP, I'm not stoked at all. You should give me dry shampoo so I don't look so ratchet.
Kacey_Laine|I've fallen in love with the delivery man because he brings me Diet Coke 😍😍 (probably because I order it...but shhhh)
Kacey_Laine|Pretty sure this was made specifically for me. Like I've said that many times before #sorrynotsorry http://t.co/pjRVio8JbU
Kacey_Laine|I've been on the Forever 21 website for the last 2 hours just adding things to my cart. Will I actually buy anything? Unknown.
Kacey_Laine|Can I stay in bed all day? Actually, don't answer that. I know the answer is yes.
Kacey_Laine|Help. I changed one color on my Google calendar and now I don't remember what it was before. And I don't like how it looks #stressed
Kacey_Laine|I like how I try to pretend like this is a new thing for me on a Friday night...ha.
Kacey_Laine|It's 8:45 on a Friday night and I'm in bed #nojudgementzone #iknowimsomuchfun #partyanimal 😍💤
Kacey_Laine|To the man in the sketchy white van that keeps making eye contact with me at every stop light- unless you have candy, please stop #butreally
Kacey_Laine|"Dear world: I apologize for my semi-ratchet look today. 
Actually, no I don't 😐 #itsfriday"
Kacey_Laine|It's time for bed, aka I'm already asleep 😴
Kacey_Laine|AHH so crazy seeing @heyingridnilsen on TV!! So proud of her 👯❤️ #PRThreads
Kacey_Laine|HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my bestest friend @DaniAustin2!!! Now come back to LA 👯❤️
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan happy birthday beautiful girl!! hope you have a fabulous day 💖
Kacey_Laine|It's not even 10am and I swapped my Starbucks for Diet Coke. Don't judge me.
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 Bahhh I miss this. And you too I guess 😍😭😭😭 #bsbforever
Kacey_Laine|"""I want to chop all my hair off because it's annoying but I like having princess hair"" - a novel by me 👸😐"
Kacey_Laine|You know that wall you hit when you're mega tired? Yeah. Hit that years ago 😐😴
Kacey_Laine|@alliesevdalis YES. I just need to get back to gold so I don't feel like I failed. Hahahah
Kacey_Laine|The only reason I'm semi-okay with having to be somewhere at 7:30 tomorrow morning, is because it gives me an excuse for Starbucks 👸💁
Kacey_Laine|Sorry bout it 😐 http://t.co/CBUa2DT3xQ
Kacey_Laine|@thecomet SAME!!! I always go but never remember to fill up my card so then I don't get stars 😭😭 but no worries. I'll get it back.
Kacey_Laine|I'm determined to get back to Gold level at Starbucks. Aka I'm going every day before work. What's bad for my wallet is good for my pride 😐
Kacey_Laine|@ilyjessicaomg Yeah haha I was just walking. Hahahah not actually ran into a wall 😝
Kacey_Laine|Remember that time I ran into a wall. Yeah, it happened again 😐 oops.
Kacey_Laine|I really want Chipotle. But it's 9:00pm. And I don't want to put on pants. And I want to go to sleep. So like...
Kacey_Laine|I'm sitting in my living room working in the dark because as soon as I get up all productivity will be lost. I'm like a small child.
Kacey_Laine|AHH. HUGE CONGRATS TO @heyingridnilsen on 3 million!!! 👯💖 (party time. aka infinite netflix)
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes I stalk my own tweets, just to see how funny I am (btdubs very funny) 💁 and I even favorite them (personal pat on the back) 😐👏
Kacey_Laine|Property Brothers is now on Netflix. Major throwback to Vidcon and watching hours of HGTV 😍 @DaniAustin2 @LandonAustin
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Bahahahaah why am I so funny??? ps. miss you. ps stalking my timeline. don't judge.
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes I can be nice...😐 http://t.co/xNZaIevCyX
Kacey_Laine|The perfect way to end your Sunday? A parking ticket. Love you too LA 😘😐
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy I'm glad I'm not alone 😂
Kacey_Laine|@CarlieStylezz YOU ARE TOO GORG 😍😍 ps. Miss your face. Must hang out next time you're in LA. Or I will just have to come to Idaho 💃
Kacey_Laine|Just went to Starbucks and paid more for parking than I did for my tea. Because I was too lazy to find street parking. Or make tea at home 😐
Kacey_Laine|Like Ben Affleck may be semi-old and he has 3 kids...but he looked good. Just saying.
Kacey_Laine|Just saw Gone Girl. Like no words. Except that it was really good.
Kacey_Laine|I'm really good at being a normal 20 year old. I'm spending my Friday night working and watching Netflix 💁 #partyanimal #iknowyourejealous
Kacey_Laine|@MissJenFABULOUS Hiiii. I texted you but idk if I have the right number...so like I may have texted some random. But I miss you like lots.
Kacey_Laine|@lifeaseva Hi lovey. Sent you a DM! 😘
Kacey_Laine|Literally LA, you're being so rude right now 😐🔫 http://t.co/mrhGngLglW
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo My life.
Kacey_Laine|"""What makeup is socially acceptable to leave on and save for tomorrow?"" -an actual question asked by Kacey Laine #bootyguru"
Kacey_Laine|This is just a guess, but I'm pretty sure I can't get up from my bed. Like my body is done moving for today/life.
Kacey_Laine|Want to know the most disappointing news in the world? I'm no longer gold level at Starbucks 😭😭 Why do I feel like I failed at life?
Kacey_Laine|“@WarnerBrosEnt: The one where... #Friends is heading to @netflix in U.S. and Canada, all 10 seasons beginning in January.” IM DYING 😍😭
Kacey_Laine|Ha remember that time my smoke alarm was going off every 5 minutes &amp; I left it for 2 weeks. Just reminiscing on how good of an adult I am 😐
Kacey_Laine|It's 9:30pm and I'm about 2 seconds from passing out. First official day of my new job tomorrow 😴👯🎉
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I know the feeling, but I also know that you can make it through. You have to know you are worthy of so much more.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan You can do it. I believe in you, now you have to believe in you ❤️
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Don't ever give up my dear. You are so strong and beautiful and you have to know that the last 9 days does mean something.
Kacey_Laine|@severshed SO GOOD.
Kacey_Laine|I guess you can say that I'm semi-obsessed with TSwift's new song. Like it's been on repeat since this morning #sorrynotsorry
Kacey_Laine|@samanthan95 HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEAUTIFUL GIRL! 💖🎉
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I know. And you will get through it. It's okay to feel. Yeah it's sucky, but your feelings are valid. You can do it ❤️
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan You can, I know it. You did it this last time, and you can do it again, Just keep going, one day at a time.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan so proud of you darling ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|And then since the top button on my phone is broken, I have to plug it back in so it'll turn back on...thanks iPhone, love you too.
Kacey_Laine|My phone likes to do this thing where it doesn't end phone calls so I have to turn it off completely.
Kacey_Laine|@alliekat815 yum to all of them 😍
Kacey_Laine|I want funfetti cake...who wants to bake me one? No one...okay whatever.
Kacey_Laine|Had dinner with the always fabulous, @PennyChic 💃 So sad to not be seeing her everyday anymore but excited for what's to come ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan always sending so much love ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|My eyes actually cannot stay open any longer. Like I'm typing this with my eyes closed #sosleepy
Kacey_Laine|75 degrees means it's time for leggings and boots #LA
Kacey_Laine|"@lovenector13 @kristeevetter Now I'm singing the ""I'm just a bill"" song..."
Kacey_Laine|I tweeted this over a year ago...nothing has changed 😂 https://t.co/nxi0tl3JHL
Kacey_Laine|@lily_marston OBSESSED.
Kacey_Laine|But like really. Why am I so funny? http://t.co/gTeH8RBPaU
Kacey_Laine|Hiiii.
Kacey_Laine|I got up extra early so I could go to the drive thru Starbucks that's 15 minutes away. That's dedication 😐 #shouldibeproud #eh
Kacey_Laine|Sleep is probably the greatest thing ever invented. Like major props to that person 🙏😴
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter WAIT. SAME.
Kacey_Laine|@hellokatyxo best day ever 🙏
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo come back to LA 😭😭
Kacey_Laine|Like I don't think you understand...I am @nicolerichie. Why are we not best friends yet? https://t.co/KEvUn5fWMn
Kacey_Laine|@MsBrittanybrat 😂😂😂
Kacey_Laine|I have no Diet Coke in my house. Someone please send help 🆘
Kacey_Laine|3am thoughts- I just feel like Oprah and I could actually be best friends.
Kacey_Laine|It's 3am and I'm watching Oprah interviews...why? I don't know.
Kacey_Laine|Now that my apartment is super clean, I realized that I really need to decorate. It looks like no one lives here 😐 @A_Fab_Life, I need you!
Kacey_Laine|Ordering food online is really dangerous. I feel like there is on judgement so I end up ordering for a family of 6...and I am by myself.
Kacey_Laine|You know when you are just laying in bed, thinking too much, and you just want to sleep forever? Yeah.

Kacey_Laine|@ananotario yep!!
Kacey_Laine|And probably from 1994-2007 too...I just didn't have a digital camera to document my awkwardness...
Kacey_Laine|The majority of these pictures will never be seen by any human. Like I don't think you understand how awkward I was in 2007-2014.
Kacey_Laine|Peace signs made me sassyyyyy. http://t.co/hhayC7OAQn
Kacey_Laine|Slay bby...but like not at all (circa 2008). http://t.co/plY8Aguj4D
Kacey_Laine|Wait. Stop. In attempts to recover my most recent iPhoto- I found my first iPhoto library, from 2007 😐 I can't. Possible pictures to come.
Kacey_Laine|Note to self: always back up your computer. Or like maybe do it once a week...it'll be good.
Kacey_Laine|@MissLovelyLayla RIGHT?!? Like the only time I use an oven is to make cookies...and usually for those- the cookie dough is better. Hahahah
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo @TheCoffeeBean @jesus @satan #hookerz?
Kacey_Laine|Also, I've lived in my apartment for a year now, and I've maybe used my oven 3 times total...4 counting today #imdomestic
Kacey_Laine|I'm using my oven in the first time in forever (to craft, obvies I'm not making food...duh) and it may explode #prayfortheoven
Kacey_Laine|QUESTION. Does anyone remember the MTV show Miss Seventeen from 2005?? Anyone?? Or just me...
Kacey_Laine|Going on Day 8 of being sick. Thank goodness for NyQuil and Netflix. Sweet dreams 😴 https://t.co/mfw556t6IU
Kacey_Laine|I really want to go on a road trip. Who wants to come with me? 🚙😍
Kacey_Laine|@87daysbefore @HowToGetAwayABC  right?!? I'm obsessed already 😍
Kacey_Laine|I always get the biggest urge to craft when I'm in bed and ready to sleep. Tomorrow will be a crafting day. What should I craft? Hahah
Kacey_Laine|I want to get back into writing. So here it is. My late night reflection on Los Angeles after a year. http://t.co/vXVTnDDGvc

Kacey_Laine|@walsh3 hahah right? Like...uh okay? Didn't know that the goal was to have them look like live caterpillars... I'll try that next time :P

Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo ✌️🐡
Kacey_Laine|Guess who has a new video coming out tomorrow??? [finally] 😁
Kacey_Laine|Food delivery is the main reason I moved to LA. Not really, but it is a nice bonus.
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 bring me someeeee.
Kacey_Laine|Times can pass and people will change, and once again, you will be left all alone.
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz my question too 😭 thank you though!!
Kacey_Laine|I almost passed out today. So that's a thing 😐 #backinbed
Kacey_Laine|Just drove past an unmarked white van playing ice cream truck music #comeonkids #no
Kacey_Laine|@kairdv 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kacey_Laine|Wut... http://t.co/3n3nwOPQeC
Kacey_Laine|Max strength DayQuil is a joke. It's doing nothing 😐😷
Kacey_Laine|Hi. Like if I can not be sick, that'd be super cool. Thanks.
Kacey_Laine|Feeling like actual death. When I said I wanted a sexy man, I didn't mean I want a sexy man's voice. Please go away.
Kacey_Laine|I sound like a super sexy man. Or a creepy man. Not sure which. But either way I sound like a man 😐
Kacey_Laine|Sick day essentials 😐 #haultime http://t.co/kPLqNFGOhn http://t.co/eprLB0kwiB
Kacey_Laine|DayQuil and NyQuil are my current best friends 😷😭
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo is that a 60 or 90?
Kacey_Laine|It's 11pm in LA, where else would we be? http://t.co/YLZuvrTcMS
Kacey_Laine|@thehomiechloe hahah I'm an actual ghost 😂👻 so great meeting you though!! ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|If you're in the fast lane going 20 below the speed limit, on a two lane road- I hate you 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|If you had to guess, who is most likely to be getting sick right now? I'm betting it's me. Literally feel like death.
Kacey_Laine|@lovelindsay I literally ask myself this everyday.
Kacey_Laine|No one gets in between me and my diet coke 💁 http://t.co/onEBzvxIo2
Kacey_Laine|It will be a miracle if I make it through this weekend. Literally dying and it's been one day. Too much people interaction for my liking.
Kacey_Laine|@kairdv I'm dying. Hahahahah
Kacey_Laine|I'm channeling my inner Sporty Spice this weekend ✌️
Kacey_Laine|@beautybaby44 HAPPY BIRTHDAY GORGEOUS!! I love you oh so much and we must celebrate when we are both back in LA 😍❤️🎉
Kacey_Laine|7am &amp; already on my first Diet Coke of the day. Spending my weekend announcing at a gymnastics competition! [lolz I'm an MC, wut is that 😐]
Kacey_Laine|I don't think you understand how ratchet I look right now. Like actually, I'm sorry to any humans I come into contact with 😐🙅
Kacey_Laine|3 hours asleep and I'm awake 😐😴 No idea how I'm supposed to make it through this weekend.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I will not since I will be busy the entire time I'm home 😝 but you can expect a new video next week!!!
Kacey_Laine|Reasons why I love being home: it's raining, wifi that isn't Time Warner, and my bed is like really really comfy [can I sleep forever?]
Kacey_Laine|Thank you to Britney Spears circa 1999 for keeping me company on this drive. Also shoutout to Diet Coke. 2 hours left 😐
Kacey_Laine|Life...like wut. I don't even know what to say. But I wanted to say hi. Getting ready to road trip home...6 hours by myself in the car, yay.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan hiiii! It's been good! Very very busy, but all good things :)
Kacey_Laine|@RickyFicarelli it's my life.
Kacey_Laine|@beautygeekxo1 I love this :)
Kacey_Laine|Less than 24 hours left in LA...I can do it [note to self: buy diet coke]
Kacey_Laine|I just found tooth paste in my fridge, and I don't remember putting it in there (or why it would be there) 😐
Kacey_Laine|@LifeWithJenn I should have a video up in the next two weeks or so!! I know- I'm so sorry I've been completely MIA :P &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|Also, I literally cannot wait until I get out of this LA heat. Like literally...I'm dying. I can't do it. Where is fall time?
Kacey_Laine|One more day in LA and then it's back home!! Still have way too much to get done, in that day...but it'll happen. maybe.
Kacey_Laine|No better way to end a long day than to start re-watching One Tree Hill from the beginning. Luhhhh this show. And Chad Michael Murray 😍😍😍
Kacey_Laine|So incredibly proud of @BethanyMota! LOVED her performance on #DWTS and can't wait to see her win it all ;) &lt;333 #TeamInternet
Kacey_Laine|@lexielombard ahhh yayyyy!! I better be seeing you all the time neighbor 😏😘
Kacey_Laine|Watching Gossip Girl and literally, they are all flawless. Like please, send me my Chuck Bass. I'd even settle for Nate. And Dan. Please? 😍
Kacey_Laine|Listening to those same songs over again, and slowly slipping back. Slipping back into the past.
Kacey_Laine|My view for the last 2 days. Oh the joys of being sick on my weekend off 😐 [and yes I'm laying in my bed upside down] http://t.co/2YfxQeGbpV
Kacey_Laine|@ElizabethFaye_ ah so jealous!!
Kacey_Laine|@cdiorme ahhh I'd be miserable 😩😁 it's way too hot
Kacey_Laine|Hey LA. Did you realize that it's mid-September and you're not supposed to be 92 degrees? 🌞😐
Kacey_Laine|Can it be Sunday forever?
Kacey_Laine|Watching Donald Glover stand up and listening to Childish Gambino. So not me...but I'm liking it 😁
Kacey_Laine|In honor of my first weekend off of work in what seems like forever, I am laying in bed and watching Netflix and eating all the food 😐🎉
Kacey_Laine|Chicken nuggets at 10am? Why not. (Note: I need to go grocery shopping)
Kacey_Laine|It's okay to be broken. It's okay to not be perfect. It's okay to need help.
Kacey_Laine|Who wants to come snuggle with me and watch cute romcoms? No one? Alright. I'll check Craigslist.
Kacey_Laine|I have two days off of work 🙏 what am I supposed to do with myself?? First things first...sleep 😴
Kacey_Laine|I made orange chicken at home and it sucks. How late is Panda Express open and do they deliver?
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I'm assuming I'm bae?...
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan You can do it!!! Keep calm and trust what you know :)
Kacey_Laine|@aspynovard @emilyjune_ i miss that and you allllllll &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|Sleep shopping is one of my special skills.
Kacey_Laine|"I'm up at midnight, so what else would I be doing other than looking at buying an iPhone 6? Looking at the stupid ""please wait"" screen..."
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves I'm on my private plane to Canada right now (well not really but like I need to see you and bebe and best friend asap)
Kacey_Laine|@kkmwalker520 I'm so sorry I've been so MIA- the past few months I've been working a ton and haven't had time for much else 😩

Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy IM DYING.
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves AHMYGOSH. How is little bebe almost 1?!?!
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes I just have to commit to sitting in traffic rather than trying to navigate the GPS side streets.
Kacey_Laine|@BethanyMota So incredibly proud to see you taking over the world 😍 keep it up beautiful!! 😘🎉
Kacey_Laine|Can I just take a week break from life and binge watch all of Gossip Girl, Greek, and One Tree Hill? Like that sounds flawless.
Kacey_Laine|All I need in life is someone to bring me food and tell me my eyebrows look good.
Kacey_Laine|@misskaiteebell seriously!!

Kacey_Laine|I don't think you can understand this level of exhaustion. In the last two weeks, I've worked 163 hours 😐😴 when is hibernation?
Kacey_Laine|Now I'm googling reviews on Chic-fil-A. I'm just prepping to eat my feelings 😐 #life

Kacey_Laine|Why am I still awake? The answer isn't because I have friends and/or a life...#nosarcasm
Kacey_Laine|Sleep sounds like flawless right now 😍😴 I'm about 3 seconds from passing out.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo it almost looks like we have friends/life drama...oooooh
Kacey_Laine|"Sleep is for the weak 🌚 I think I just ""threw shade"" (#amihipyet) at myself. Whatever that means. Did I even use that right? 😐🌚"
Kacey_Laine|Lo siento for the billion tweets tonight. But I just found vlog footage from LA from like a year and a half ago. Wittle bebe 😐😭
Kacey_Laine|I know my life is slightly a mess because I haven't gotten my eyebrows professionally done since March 😐 send help.
Kacey_Laine|Pretty much-can we like maybe add a few hours to the day? Like I'd settle for an additional 5 hours. Or maybe round out a solid 30 hour day?
Kacey_Laine|But I can guarantee that tomorrow I will be wanting 6 more hours of sleep.
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes I feel like sleep is just a waste of time. Like that's a solid 6 extra hours I could have in a day #dowerk
Kacey_Laine|I've had old school Taylor Swift on repeat for the last 3 days. I love it. Can I be her?

Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan always sending you so much love and strength babygirl. You can do this ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|Today is a major struggle day for my phone. Aka it doesn't want to stay charged for anyone (aka me).
Kacey_Laine|I'm at work and there are a billion children next door singing/screaming Frozen. Can I join them? #letitgo
Kacey_Laine|The idea of actually getting ready &amp; putting on real clothes today like isn't working for me. Hello stretchy pants, we'll be bffs today 😁
Kacey_Laine|@heyingridnilsen Hi. You looked absolutely GORG at the VMAs. Just had to say that. I am so incredibly proud of you 💗💗 #cheeseemoji
Kacey_Laine|@thecomet Hahahahah 😂😂
Kacey_Laine|While everyone was at the VMAs, I spent all night watching Community. You tell me who had a better night (hint: I didn't have to wear pants)
Kacey_Laine|@nithya138 @kaitlin_model Let me know if you find another one!!
Kacey_Laine|"@nithya138 @kaitlin_model YES IT""S PERFECT!! :D"
Kacey_Laine|@nithya138 YOU ARE A LIFESAVER.
Kacey_Laine|Help. Where can I watch the actual VMA show live online? Is that possible? Help meeee.
Kacey_Laine|Kidding. I'm at home cleaning #imfunipromise
Kacey_Laine|VMA's, I'm here. Look out for me, I'm Britney Spears wearing a snake. http://t.co/952JByukuB
Kacey_Laine|@kairdv ...wait for a second I was like, why not? It's a pretty name &amp; her nickname could be ella...I have passed the point of being tired.
Kacey_Laine|Someone send help. I'm online window shopping and it's getting dangerously close to online real shopping...#nokacey
Kacey_Laine|Currently looking at pictures of BSpears and JT and crying. Who would wear a jean suit for me? #truelove http://t.co/5j9xsCjG9n
Kacey_Laine|I set up the digital adapter for my TV all by myself. I'm like so so so good at being an adult 😐
Kacey_Laine|@kairdv That's my calling in life.
Kacey_Laine|• exploring LA • @ Venice Canals. http://t.co/CcI9NAaOht
Kacey_Laine|My plan for today? Absolutely nothing ☺️
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood 😂😂 just woke up, and about to go back to sleep 😁
Kacey_Laine|It's almost midnight. I am running off 4 hours of sleep and a 13 hour work day. Yet for some reason I am planning out my dream home. Yes.
Kacey_Laine|@PennyChic ...stuck in Venice with no car keys? Maybe?
Kacey_Laine|"Home from a long day of ""work"" w/ @PennyChic (hard to call it work when it's this fun) So proud of my fave ❤️🎉 http://t.co/JIbV0dF6I8"
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz old. So no. Hahaha
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie AH CONGRATS!!! 😍🎉
Kacey_Laine|"Some guy just complimented me on my ""nice riding boots"". I'm wearing combat boots 😐"
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 AH SO CUTE 😍
Kacey_Laine|Behind the scenes of an exciting new @PennyChic project 💃🎉 http://t.co/lKvEj0BxQi
Kacey_Laine|"“@PopTrigger: The Biebs Shaves Off His ""Mustache"" http://t.co/VuMEhTqkVq @SamSchacher @BreeEssrig @bretterlich @Kacey_Laine” hey that's me 😁"
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood right?! It's so relaxing :) and there's still a lot of people on the roads (all the time) but at least it moves 😁
Kacey_Laine|One of my favorite things is driving around LA early in the morning 😍 #cheesyLAtweet
Kacey_Laine|I have yet to go to bed. I have to be at work in 6 hours. I'm sorry in advance to anyone I encounter tomorrow.
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie Ah that's so exciting!! Congratulations!!
Kacey_Laine|@amarixe This reminded me that I need to do that asap. Like my collection has gotten too bad...if that's possible (it is).
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie busy busy busy!! Hahaha but good :) How have you been?!

Kacey_Laine|@akaydoll happy birthday pretty girl!! Hope you have an amazing day 😘🎉
Kacey_Laine|@CarlieStylezz I'll join youu!! 😍💃🇺🇸

Kacey_Laine|Had so much fun filming with @PopTrigger today!! Stay tuned for that on http://t.co/jhKbg1pFV5 💃🎉 http://t.co/efX7PqZZSJ
Kacey_Laine|I blame Taylor Swift if I'm late today. Despite waking up 3 hours early, I felt the need to waste that time dancing around to Shake It Off 💃
Kacey_Laine|"Oh the joys of city life. Waking up to a screaming match outside, and hearing a neighbor yell ""People are trying to sleep!"" 😐 #ilovepeople"
Kacey_Laine|@o_m_g_no_way thank you so much, that really means a lot to me ❤️
Kacey_Laine|@carrie_rad The older I get the more I realize how much I love sleep. Like I just lay in bed and love it so much 😍😴
Kacey_Laine|I'm in bed at 9pm 😍🙏
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo When do you come back to America? https://t.co/hj3U3LFTat
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Please, if not for yourself, do it for me- start knowing that you are so worthy in this world, and believe in yourself &lt;3
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan ...and you need to believe that. Start putting yourself first, know that your happiness is always a priority in your life.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Never my darling, and you know that. You need to stop putting yourself down though, you are a beautiful and amazing girl...
Kacey_Laine|@lucyonelove Hahah not at all. It's been on for the past 2 hours. On repeat. Hahaha I love it ;P
Kacey_Laine|@hayyitsaudrey oh no worries, me too. Been listening to it on repeat all morning 😍🙈
Kacey_Laine|You could've been getting down to this. sick. beat.
Kacey_Laine|Can I get food delivered to my bed? Or is that like a sign I'm too lazy? Sorry I got hungry after I got all snuggled up 😐
Kacey_Laine|@Iikeohmygod Absolutely!!
Kacey_Laine|I'm sorry I've been so MIA lately!! Been super busy with work and exciting new things in life but I'm still here!! Love you all &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@alexalosey My life in a tweet.
Kacey_Laine|@LacyCavalier DYING 😍😭
Kacey_Laine|@madiglam1 Happy birthday pretty girl!! &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan always sending love to you my dear 💗💗
Kacey_Laine|Living alone and finding a bug in my apartment makes me want to cry forever 😭🙈 Someone come kill the bug for me. I'll love you forever.
Kacey_Laine|"""Chris and I could make a beautiful rainbow""...wut? &amp; she's rewarding him for chasing her. aka not rejecting her rose 😐 #BachelorInParadise"
Kacey_Laine|Taylor Swift is my spirit animal.
Kacey_Laine|😴😴😴
Kacey_Laine|I haven't tweeted in over a day. I'm still alive. I know y'all were so worried about me 😐
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood yes definitely am!! Thank you 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|Agh I am so sorry but I will not be at BeautyCon LA today. I woke up super sick &amp; need to take today to rest 😫 Sending lots of hugs though!!
Kacey_Laine|Wow. Just realized that 4 years ago today, I uploaded my very first YouTube video. Thank you so much for coming on this wonderful journey &lt;3
Kacey_Laine|My goal for tonight is to go to bed before midnight. Aka something I haven't done in a while. Which is strange since I'm a grandma...
Kacey_Laine|Okay. So like BeautyCon is tomorrow and I have absolutely nothing to wear. Is it socially acceptable to wear my footie pajamas?
Kacey_Laine|@AprilLockhart ME.
Kacey_Laine|I have a 12 pack of Diet Coke and a 4 pack of Redbull in my car. I feel like this is an accurate representation of who I am.
Kacey_Laine|I'm in love 😍 Sam Hunt is actually perfect. Like please marry me. http://t.co/LAIuCLYilr
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan no need to apologize my love. The most important thing is that you take care of yourself ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|@ZezeMarafie yes yes!!
Kacey_Laine|Just realized that #BeautyConLA is like 2 days away and I have absolutely nothing to wear and no time to shop...😁🙈
Kacey_Laine|@yukiimutoo awh you are too sweet 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|@hh4130 glad I'm not alone 😁
Kacey_Laine|@beccabean17 right?! I ate at 8am then went till 7pm before I realized I hadn't eaten again 😝 and last week was up for 40 hours straight!
Kacey_Laine|I really need to figure out my sleep schedule. Like asap. I'm so tired, yet for some reason I am still awake &amp; stalking the internet...why.
Kacey_Laine|I must say though, the Bachelor franchise is always one step ahead in men's fashion- scarves were so last season. Now it's necklaces.
Kacey_Laine|"I finally watched this week's Bachelor in Paradise. I'm obsessed. But one thing- how was Dylan saying I don't like you, a ""mixed message""? 😐"
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy COME HANG OUT WITH ME.
Kacey_Laine|I need to find someone to go to Mexican food with. Because going by myself makes me look silly. Hit me up 😐
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo don't leave meeee 😭
Kacey_Laine|@lovenector13 you are too cute! Happy birthday lovey!!
Kacey_Laine|Why did she turn down Paris?? 😭 And why am I (once again) awake at 1am watching The Hills??
Kacey_Laine|Except I do know how to binge watch Netflix shows...that I will say, I am quite good at.
Kacey_Laine|For the amount of time I spend on my computer, I am absolutely clueless about all things tech related.
Kacey_Laine|Guess who was productive today? Me. Got home from work &amp; went on a run (but it was really a walk since I have the body of an 80 year old) 👊
Kacey_Laine|@AprilLockhart noooo don't leave me!! 😭
Kacey_Laine|Finally home 😍 After a billion hours of traffic (which was made better by my John Mayer playlist), it is time to sleep 😴😴
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo WE ARE THE SAME.
Kacey_Laine|It's almost midnight. I'm on the 5 in bumper to bumper traffic. Am I back in LA yet? 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|“@michellexxo: Why do I not have a group of friends like How I Met Your Mother, Friends, or The Hills? My life is a failure so far.” GOALS 🙌
Kacey_Laine|Watched the sun set while driving through the middle of nowhere. LA, I'll see you soon 😍
Kacey_Laine|Please, if you or someone you know is battling depression, know that it's okay to ask for help- this isn't a fight you have to do alone ❤️
Kacey_Laine|I really should go to bed, but it's 1am and I'm rewatching The Hills season 1. When did I decide this was a good idea? 😐
Kacey_Laine|So happy looking at my timeline tonight!! Sending out huge congrats to @BethanyMota and @tyleroakley 😍 So proud of #TeamInternet ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|So like what do I have to do to be adopted by Kim Kardashian?
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan @DaniAustin2 Take care of yourself darling. That's most important ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|@ellefowler SO STUNNING. Like legit you both look gorgeous 😘 have fun!!
Kacey_Laine|So I'm keeping this for myself. http://t.co/qCJIv97F7G
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo and if there's not, I'll make one.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo maybe. Not sure. I feel like I could try.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo me.
Kacey_Laine|Dry shampoo is bae 😍 (don't worry, I hate myself for using bae too)
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo A man so great he needed two names.
Kacey_Laine|But like really...@michellexxo 😂😂 http://t.co/oXsEEzFJ7g
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood I've been watching your videos for the last hour and I just wanted to say hi :)
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves Okay first off. Happy belated birthday! Second off. I miss you like way too much. When are you and bebe coming to LA??
Kacey_Laine|@amarixe Sending so much love and positivity to you and your mama. I want you to know that I am always here for you, whatever you need &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|Time to hibernate for all of life 😴
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz I have no idea. Hahaha literally about to pass out right now. Soooo sleepy!
Kacey_Laine|I've officially been awake for way too long. I need to go to sleep. Like right now.
Kacey_Laine|So happy to be home and reunited with all my friends 😍 [What?! Kacey has friends?!]
Kacey_Laine|I've been awake for going on 36 hours...like how am I even still functioning right now?
Kacey_Laine|The only way to survive a road trip at midnight...blasting old school Britney Spears and having a mini concert.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan always lovey ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|@beautybaby44 WAIT. NO. I'M GOING TO MISS IT :(((((
Kacey_Laine|Tonight I got to see my favorite, @DaniAustin2 and her mama! Love my southern family &lt;33 Now it's time to prepare myself for the week ahead.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan not setting yourself up for a positive outcome. So stay positive and know that everything will be okay in the end &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan You can do it, I know you can. Stay positive and believe in yourself. If you go in with a negative mind set though, you're
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Always my dear &lt;3 Senior year was honestly my favorite. Enjoy it, &amp; know that there is always something positive to see &lt;3
Kacey_Laine|That's the way God made her, sunshine mixed with a little hurricane ♡
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter YAS YAS YASSSSS. Like it's been way too long since I've seen your face.
Kacey_Laine|GUESS WHAT?! I will be at #BeautyConLA!! Who will I be seeing there?? @BeautyConTweets http://t.co/89QGMY94w2 http://t.co/n97P1gONxW
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo That's why I did one section a day. Couldn't take any more than that.
Kacey_Laine|@CarlyCristman so many man necklaces, so little time...
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo YOU LOVE IT.
Kacey_Laine|@ellefowler 😂 me all the time.
Kacey_Laine|@iheartmakeup92 YES. I get like separation anxiety from deleting pictures cuz I feel like I'll need them! 😂
Kacey_Laine|Hold up. Robert on #BachelorInParadise 😍 like yes.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo are you mocking me? [also are we hanging out soon?] [yes please]
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo okay you're gorgeous. Not fair. We can't be friends.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu ...is this like a real thing people do?
Kacey_Laine|I guess my one question about this show is, how many scarves should we expect to see? @chrisbharrison #BachelorInParadise
Kacey_Laine|Is it bad that I'm like really excited for #BachelorInParadise to start? Don't judge me...or do...whatever.
Kacey_Laine|I just used a gift card that I got for my birthday to buy groceries. Is that a sign that I'm a real adult now?
Kacey_Laine|HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY to one of my bestest friends in the whole wide world, @meghanrosette!! Love you so so much!! Now go conquer Vegas ❤️🎉💃
Kacey_Laine|@MakeupbyMandy24 Sending you lots of love darling. I'm always here for you, anything you need ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|Life is a roller coaster of emotions. Especially when it comes to the drive thru line at Taco Bell. http://t.co/S2SRfuMzkm
Kacey_Laine|Wait. There was no traffic, and it's starting to rain...am I still in LA? Or is this the world ending...😐
Kacey_Laine|I'm really impressed with myself. I got out of bed so I could see the sunset in real life instead of just looking at pictures on Twitter.
Kacey_Laine|But like actually though, can Nicole Richie be my best friend?
Kacey_Laine|😴😴😴
Kacey_Laine|Why hello there 4am...
Kacey_Laine|To do lists are the only thing that keeps me somewhat sane.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I DIE.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan love you darling!! Thinking about you and sending lots of love your way!
Kacey_Laine|@NikkiPhillippi Ah so gorg!! Loved shooting with you and we most def need to hang out very soon 😍

Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo BYE. CRYING. GETTING ON A PLANE RIGHT NOW TO NASHVILLE.
Kacey_Laine|@NikkiPhillippi Hey love! Texted you yesterday but not sure if I have the right number. Wanted to see about Friday :) xx
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu 😂 I called my sister once to ask how to use it and she laughed at me and then I hung up. So it just sits empty in my fridge.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu I'm like a real life adult. Almost. Except for the fact I still don't know how to use my brita filter. Minor detail.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan sending the biggest hugs and love your way ❤️❤️❤️

Kacey_Laine|Sleep? What's that? Hi 3am.
Kacey_Laine|All the nights in my life where I feel like it wouldn't be a surprise if I was murdered, I've been with @michellexxo.

Kacey_Laine|Why is it, that at 11:30pm, I get a great desire to craft/shop home decor/redecorate my apartment? Like no, sleep time.
Kacey_Laine|I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of. But I've learned, you can't let these things define who you are.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo @LacyCavalier We like to think we have more friends than we actually do...
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo @LacyCavalier Is there a reason I've like never seen this picture/just found it?? I miss you ladies. http://t.co/i6C2ZW2quE
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz yessss :/ hahaha I'm not good at the whole being an adult thing.
Kacey_Laine|I just spent 20 minutes going through papers to try and find my license plate number when it would have taken me 2 to go outside and look.
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY FAVORITE MAMA AUSTIN! Sending lots of love and birthday wishes!! &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|@BergerSarahE STOP IT. SMUGGLE ME IN.
Kacey_Laine|The amount of traffic in LA right now. I'm trapped in my apartment 😐🔫 #ThanksObama
Kacey_Laine|@MsMeghanMakeup I was supposed to be thereeeee 😩 but I'm not. But I better be seeing your face soon in my life.
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 I'm taking your favorite of that tweet as your way of saying yes we will hang out forever and ever on kaceys birthday ☺️😏😘
Kacey_Laine|My birthday is in exactly one week (29th). I will be 20. And I will be in LA. So LA friends, please hang out with me so I'm not alone 👸💁🐒
Kacey_Laine|@AymzzXD too much time committed :P
Kacey_Laine|@forever_jazminn I've spent way too much time on this game.
Kacey_Laine|I'm an A list celeb, yet I still don't have enough stars to adopt a cat 😐 #realworldstruggles #kimkworldstruggles

Kacey_Laine|@mats_anna awhh I love you too!! But if you need to go to sleep, get some sleep!! 😘❤️
Kacey_Laine|@sunlight_hemmo ...maybeeee 😏☺️
Kacey_Laine|HI. 3pm [PST] is almost here. Any guesses on why that may be special? http://t.co/PwL5cK43P7
Kacey_Laine|@hellokatyxo I'm glad I'm not alone. A guilty pleasure is looking up font combos on Pinterest. Some girls pin wedding rings...me, fonts.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo 😭😭😭 noooo. I better see you like asap.
Kacey_Laine|I got a $0.45 FasTrak violation fee. Like how is that even worth it for them to mail out the notification?
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo WHAT?!? You're leaving me on my birthday?! And not taking me with you?!? 😭
Kacey_Laine|3:40am. Hi, lovely to see you [not really, can I please fall back to sleep].
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan yeah that's what I'm thinking. Hopefully it goes away soon!!
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz I think it's just a basic stomach bug, if it lasts for a few days longer or if it gets worse, I'll go to the doctor probably :P
Kacey_Laine|Second night in a row that I'm sick and throwing up 😭😷 Someone send over soup, 7up, and snuggles.
Kacey_Laine|@kellyribble yesss I'm obsessed with all his music 😍😍
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy ❤️❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|I'm really good at stalking people on social media. Like so much that I'll be looking at someone's page and have no idea how I found them 😐
Kacey_Laine|The Bachelorette Men Tell All. I'm ready to find out where they get all their fabulous man scarves.
Kacey_Laine|'Speakers' by @SamHuntMusic 😍 yes please.
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie Eeeeek!
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Awh thank you my dear. Been resting all day so hopefully I'll feel better soon!
Kacey_Laine|Hi. I hope y'all haven't forgotten about me. Maybe look on http://t.co/NxHypAq5lx tomorrow at 3pm...just saying ;)
Kacey_Laine|The Kim Kardashian game is in my Lifestyle apps folder...something may be wrong with me.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo @nicolelovesUtoo I'm in.
Kacey_Laine|@GraceSings91 thanks lovey!! Got your email, can't wait to listen!!
Kacey_Laine|Woke up still feeling sick so today will be a low key day. What are y'all up to?
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Asleep. But woke up. But going back to sleep [because that makes a lot of sense...]
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Good thing I am randomly awake. But like yes, this is happening.
Kacey_Laine|Throwing up/being sick when you live alone is no fun. No one to hold my hair back, or bring me soup, or cuddle me till I fall asleep 😭😷
Kacey_Laine|Laying in bed. Feeling so sick. So sleepy. Can't think. This is kind of the worst.
Kacey_Laine|Instead of going out into the real world, I just watch reality TV. It's practically the same thing, right?
Kacey_Laine|HEY YOU. Y'all need to vote for @AprilLockhart on the Rising Star app!! She is so talented and an amazing friend &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@Molly64577176 Eeeeek! Birthday twins!!
Kacey_Laine|@connyelizabeth7 Right?! I feel like at 20 I need to have it together...and I'm def not close. Hahahah
Kacey_Laine|@MamaMiaMakeup 29th!! :D
Kacey_Laine|I have less than 10 days left of my teen years. What am I supposed to do?
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu I'm a functioning adult, I promise...
Kacey_Laine|It took 5 minutes of me trying to use my vegetable peeler before I realized the plastic was still on it 😐
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan love you moreee 😘❤️
Kacey_Laine|@LacyCavalier ps. you are perfecter and I miss you times a billion and I'm going to come live in Nashville so I can see you all the time.
Kacey_Laine|“@LacyCavalier: There's no in between for me... I either look GOSH AWFUL or completely done up.” 🙌 ME
Kacey_Laine|"It's 10:30pm and I'm in bed, reading. I know, I'm living the ""LA party girl"" life that everyone desires oh so much."
Kacey_Laine|I keep forgetting I have cell service again so I am unintentionally not replying to texts. Sorry in advance.
Kacey_Laine|@sunlight_hemmo Yes!! I will hopefully have a new one up in the next few days!!!
Kacey_Laine|Does someone want to come unpack for me while I lay in bed and catch up on my TV shows from the last week?
Kacey_Laine|In other news, tomorrow I start my post vacation-being healthy-detox thing. We'll see how long this lasts.
Kacey_Laine|I miss Sheila &amp; Michael [our amazing waiters/BFFs while on the cruise]. Who is going to supply me with endless dinner followed by cookies? 😭
Kacey_Laine|After 8 days of being away on a boat, I'm finally home. I've missed you babyboo [Netflix].
Kacey_Laine|@MsBrittanybrat I just got back and LA (and me) misses you too 😭😭
Kacey_Laine|Hi LA.
Kacey_Laine|"""But in first class you don't get to watch the safety video"" Overheard while boarding the plane #RealWorldProblemsContinued"
Kacey_Laine|“@_luisavaz: @Kacey_Laine Oh how I missed having you on twitter!” I'm back 😁
Kacey_Laine|Update. She made up with her friend and they have plans to go to Chipotle tonight #happyendingsdoexist
Kacey_Laine|"Overheard at the Seattle airport. A teenage girl who is ""literally so mad"" at her friend who won't go to the concert #RealWorldProblems"
Kacey_Laine|Spotted in the Seattle airport. A grown man in light wash overalls. Told y'all they were back in style.
Kacey_Laine|Just had TSA check my hair again. I'm sorry that you see a fabulous messy bun as a security threat.
Kacey_Laine|"""My favorite part of the trip was when I met you"" -another quote from Swiss army kid to his new best friend. How sweet."
Kacey_Laine|"""I want a Swiss Army knife so I can take stuff from my pocket and make an arrow.""- an actual quote from some kid going through customs."
Kacey_Laine|LA. I'm coming for you.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo your car is cursed.
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 Don't leave meeee 😭😭😭
Kacey_Laine|One more night of boat life. I'm hoping for free cookies and Bingo #reasonsilovecruises
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood that sounds fabulous 😍😍 @TheTubeCruise, let's make this happen 😏
Kacey_Laine|"Every time I go through the guards getting on or off of the boat I try to start a chant of ""USA"". The Canadian border patrol isn't amused."
Kacey_Laine|Also on this cruise I've seen an abnormal amount of crocs, visors, and jorts #comfortiskey #notcomplaining #jkyesiam #stopit #USA
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood sounds legit 😏😂
Kacey_Laine|I have less than 24 hours left on this cruise &amp; I have yet to sneak onto the front of the boat to recreate the Titanic scene #CueCelineDion
Kacey_Laine|"Being a tourist and stuff. Aka updating snapchat with pictures of my ""adventures"". Aka trying to find free wifi. http://t.co/x9tFphke4P"
Kacey_Laine|@_mllelovato I'll be back soon!! 😘
Kacey_Laine|Fashion observations on a cruise: Sketchers are cool. If your jeans are bedazzled, yes. Wear a sweatshirt with a random city on it #killinit
Kacey_Laine|Canada is pretty nice. They have free wifi.
Kacey_Laine|I'm losing service again. Just wanted to let y'all know I'm still alive. Back to boat life.
Kacey_Laine|Taking advantage of the wifi in this cafe and downloading @LacyCavalier's new EP [hint, you should too] 😘 http://t.co/pu8S9Jio6l
Kacey_Laine|Uploading this from the only café with wifi access #citylife @ Skagway, Alaska http://t.co/MwBOcf3rOg
Kacey_Laine|I played with sled dog puppies today #kaceydoeshaveaheart
Kacey_Laine|This whole no wifi/cell service is nice. It hides the fact that I'm not getting texts from anyone.
Kacey_Laine|I'm really making a fashion statement on this cruise thing. Currently wearing a shirt from the 90s, leggings, tall fuzzy socks, &amp; slippers.
Kacey_Laine|Trying to get your winged eyeliner even while on a moving boat...I think I can accomplish anything now.
Kacey_Laine|I'm in Alaska. I haven't had wifi/cell service since Friday. What have I missed?
Kacey_Laine|Living on a boat for the next week.
Kacey_Laine|@LandonAustin @AllieMarieEvans @DaniAustin2 everyone but you.
Kacey_Laine|“@olivegarden: @Kacey_Laine The only thing that could make the day better would be some To Go breadsticks-- see you when you get back! ⚓” 😍
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood awhh you are too sweet 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|I'm waiting to board the cruise ship and the most productive thing I've done today is followed @olivegarden on Twitter #goodday
Kacey_Laine|Being awake since 2 am has sent me into a very delirious state of being. I'm so tired, but I have forgotten how to sleep.
Kacey_Laine|In my hotel watching HGTV. Major Vidcon throwback.
Kacey_Laine|I'm at Starbucks in Seattle #tourist
Kacey_Laine|Classic plane picture. Complete with nature, a dramatic lens flare, and the patriotic plane wing. http://t.co/Ax9BBTloXm
Kacey_Laine|There are so many old people at this airport. Just an observation.
Kacey_Laine|My talents include getting to a location and immediately finding an outlet and the wifi.
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood only here for the day, then our cruise leaves from here!
Kacey_Laine|I am in the home of Starbucks. Hello. And I'm stuck at the airport for 3 hours. Yay.
Kacey_Laine|I'm stuck on this plane and all I want is a burrito. Someone send help.
Kacey_Laine|Update: I opened my window because I wanted to see outside/take pictures with my phone. Okay. That's all.
Kacey_Laine|What's the window etiquette on planes? No one has theirs open, but I peeked out mine and I want to open it to look but idk if that's rude...
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 2am 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|Someone send me snacks on this plane. I only have 30 minutes left on the flight but I'm hungry/bored. Also I'm thirsty. Just some thoughts.
Kacey_Laine|Trying to sleep on the plane and I keep moving and waking myself up and I think it's scaring the person next to me. Sorry.
Kacey_Laine|Despite LAX being my second home, I still don't automatically connect to the wifi 😭 And right now it won't even let me join #sonothappy
Kacey_Laine|It's far too early to be awake and functioning right now.
Kacey_Laine|2am. So nice to see you 😐 not. Time to get up and readyyyy (aka time to start drinking diet coke so I don't fall back asleep).
Kacey_Laine|I have to be awake in 5 hours. And I'm wasting my time watching Cake Boss and playing the Kim Kardashian game. Someone come put me to sleep.
Kacey_Laine|“@kairdv: @Kacey_Laine Ryan goslings surprise proposal to you” I KNEW IT. That whole Eva's preggerz thing was a cover up.
Kacey_Laine|There's a helicopter circling my apartment with a spotlight and a loud speaker saying something. What's going on...lyke wut?
Kacey_Laine|@AprilLockhart WAIT. HOW LONG YOU IN LA FOR? [LETS HOPE FOREVER SO WE CAN EXPLORE AND GET CUPCAKES]
Kacey_Laine|I triple checked that my 4 alarms are set for the morning yet I'm still freaking out that they won't go off &amp; I'll sleep through my flight 😐
Kacey_Laine|7:30 and I'm in bed. I would say that having to get up at 2am is my excuse, but I do this normally 😐🐒
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan you're so pretty my dear! Stop putting yourself down 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|@pfleming13 eeeek!!! Run!!! 😬
Kacey_Laine|Ew. Like why 😐 http://t.co/YCg9TIeg2h
Kacey_Laine|@kandeejohnson Happy birthday pretty lady! I am so blessed to know you and hope you have a truly amazing day 😘❤️🎉
Kacey_Laine|I have to be at the airport in 12 hours. That means I have to be awake in 12 hours. I wish that were a joke 😭
Kacey_Laine|Where's the nearest Panera? And does it deliver...?
Kacey_Laine|I think I packed everything. And I think I still have room in my bag. I don't want to jinx it. But it may be a miracle.
Kacey_Laine|I am leaving in 16 hours for an 8 day trip and I have yet to start packing. Someone please send help.
Kacey_Laine|@MsBrittanybrat I've got last minute packing/work to do but I'll be back the 18th and we can partyyyy (aka food and pillow pets).
Kacey_Laine|@MsBrittanybrat I stalked your snapchat I decided we are hanging out asap and you're introducing me to real life fun people and chick-fil-a.
Kacey_Laine|Watching Footloose for the 3rd night in a row. I have no regrets. Only a strong love for choreographed dance.
Kacey_Laine|@mere_follow I really like that ❤️
Kacey_Laine|And the things on my splurge list aren't even absurd splurges- they're like I need them forever in my life splurges [$$$comefindme]
Kacey_Laine|I have 2 things on my must have now splurge list, but I have to be an adult &amp; save money for rent and not super girly things 😐 #imafakeadult
Kacey_Laine|“@pfleming13: “@Kacey_Laine: The Kim Kardashian game. I'm sorry but it's a thing in my life...😐” it has taken over my life” 😩 but yes.
Kacey_Laine|The Kim Kardashian game. I'm sorry but it's a thing in my life...😐
Kacey_Laine|The number of times I've answered the door w/o pants on should be embarrassing. But I like my oversized knockoff Miley Cyrus concert tee 😐
Kacey_Laine|Why does my mailman wait to deliver the mail? I'm sorry but it's almost 8pm, I'm not going to have pants on when I answer the door 😐 #sorry
Kacey_Laine|Would it be socially acceptable to go to bed now? I'm done with today. And don't want to [and can't] be productive anymore.
Kacey_Laine|Today will be spent importing footage, editing, doing laundry, cleaning and packing. Someone come help me please.
Kacey_Laine|If you say that choreographed dance routines in movies is a bad idea, then you are so wrong #iliveforchoreographeddance
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I would never, Paydan. I believe in you and all you have to offer this world. Now you have to believe in you ❤️
Kacey_Laine|I google (hot male) celebrities heights in my spare time. This is one of the reasons why Zac Efron and I will never be together.
Kacey_Laine|Previews show Marcus's solid man scarf game. I never even knew this was a thing 😐 #TheBachelorette
Kacey_Laine|First sighting of a man scarf. I am not disappointed #TheBachelorette
Kacey_Laine|The moment of panic when it's 2 minutes till The Bachelorette and your TV won't turn on because your remote is broken 😬
Kacey_Laine|The Bachelorette is on in 40 minutes. I can only hope that there are some fabulous man scarves featured tonight.
Kacey_Laine|@chwelsea The number of scrunchies I still own should be embarrassing, but after 15 years of gymnastics you get quite the collection #loveit
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz oh I always do that 😂
Kacey_Laine|I left my apartment wearing a gold scrunchie. And I was fully aware of this. Yet I still did it. I apologize to everyone.
Kacey_Laine|I want to go check my mail to see if Footloose came yet, but that requires me putting on pants/clothing...and I don't want to do that.
Kacey_Laine|I keep hearing ducks quacking outside my window but I don't know what they are from cuz I don't think there are ducks in the middle of LA.
Kacey_Laine|I want Chiptole. There's one .5 miles from me, but I like really don't want to walk to it. So I may drive to it...is that too lazy? #sorry
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu I've never read a more perfect tweet.
Kacey_Laine|Sitting down to film for the first time in what feels like forever (because it has been forever). Words don't work. English no good.
Kacey_Laine|Sweet dreams of Ryan Gosling building you a home and being a bird 😍
Kacey_Laine|I have a strong desire to watch The Notebook. Who wants to come cuddle with me while I cry about the perfect love story 😭❤️
Kacey_Laine|In that delirious state right before you pass the bleep out. I told my sister that I wanted to help Kevin Bacon so dancing can be legal 😩😴😂
Kacey_Laine|You know when you hear a song and instantly connect to it on a personal level... http://t.co/aNZBMOJTo3
Kacey_Laine|Apparently my Amazon order [Footloose on DVD for $6] is being delivered today. I didn't know they did mail on Sunday 😐 #thisbetternotbeajoke
Kacey_Laine|Currently dying from the worlds worst headache. Please excuse me while I hate life 😭😩
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie Oooh that's interesting!! What does it taste like??
Kacey_Laine|SO now my question for you! What kind of videos do you want to see? Send any and all requests you have! GO GO GO!
Kacey_Laine|Spending today getting organized and inspired to film tomorrow. I really miss y'all and want to get good content out to you very soon!
Kacey_Laine|@ellefowler Only the essential phrases for a fabulous Europe trip 😂😂 Have fun my dear!! 😘
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan don't stress my darling ❤️ I hope everything is going well and I'm always sending you so much love.
Kacey_Laine|@alexalosey I love Vegas. You should have kidnapped me and we could have both been fetuses in Vegas.
Kacey_Laine|I have 4 days left in LA before I am gone for 8 days w/ limited wifi. I have so much to get done yet I am sitting in my bed watching movies.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu I love how you send me the link 😂😂 ps. I miss you like way a lot and you need to come to la like asap.
Kacey_Laine|@Love_Lauren_E Happy birthday beautiful girl!! Hope you have an amazing day!! 😘❤️🎉
Kacey_Laine|Went to get my oil changed looking like a complete mess, and the guy said I have beautiful eyes and gave me $10 off. Some people are good.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu wait what??
Kacey_Laine|Weird dreams all night. Like I'm just confused. And still tired.
Kacey_Laine|I love that feeling of weightlessness that hits you right before you fall asleep ❤️😴
Kacey_Laine|My favorite part of not having houseguests is that I get to watch Netflix all day (without judgement) and I never have to wear pants.
Kacey_Laine|@annarodgers_1d thank you so much, that really means a lot to me ❤️
Kacey_Laine|@missbarbiegal19 I just tweeted a little bit about my filming situation, but I'm not gone- I will be back :)
Kacey_Laine|But in the meantime, I truly do love you all so much, and appreciate y'all sticking with me &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|...able to get myself in a place where I am inspired. Hopefully this will pass and I can come back with good content for y'all!
Kacey_Laine|I just want y'all to know that I am still alive, just YouTube MIA. The last few weeks have been busy/weird and I have't been...
Kacey_Laine|I thought there was a mini earthquake but it was just me getting super dizzy...that's fun, kinda.
Kacey_Laine|It's Saturday night and I'm cuddled up in bed watching a movie. I wouldn't have it any other way.
Kacey_Laine|"@michellexxo ""Stop it. I can't with that accent. It's just too cute. Shut up."" 😂"
Kacey_Laine|• from her cowboy boots, to her down home roots • Had such a fun 4th of July with my lovely ladies 🇺🇸❤️✨ http://t.co/v5GqH3NUB3
Kacey_Laine|Fireworks on the beach 😘🇺🇸✨
Kacey_Laine|I learned I have a 4.9 Uber rating. I feel like I'm doing good in life.
Kacey_Laine|Guess who's wearing cowboy boots out in LA today? 🇺🇸✨ @DazzleMeHay #america
Kacey_Laine|Spending my 4th of July morning watching Girl Meets World because why not...#mrfeenyisamerica #yesijusthashtaggedthat #america
Kacey_Laine|It's 11pm and I'm looking up where the nearest Panda Express is #iwantorangechicken
Kacey_Laine|Also I'm like really excited to go shopping the day after the 4th and get all of the USA themed decor on sale #sorryiloveamerica #again
Kacey_Laine|Tomorrow is the 4th of July. Now my American flag apartment decor can seem normal #sorryiloveamerica
Kacey_Laine|Just bought Footloose off Amazon for $6 and it'll get here on Monday. I've never been more excited in my life.
Kacey_Laine|"I have Britney Spears' ""Email My Heart"" stuck in my head. I feel like that's not something that normal people deal with..."
Kacey_Laine|@carrie_rad LOVE LOVE LOVE!
Kacey_Laine|4th of July nails. Happening right now ❤️🇺🇸 http://t.co/ZO9WG6cfxe
Kacey_Laine|I am trying to organize my apartment but I keep getting distracted &amp; end up laying in bed watching Netflix. Like I don't wanna do anything 😐
Kacey_Laine|@KalelKitten this is perfect 😂 I remember my sister getting a blow up chair for her birthday &amp; me crying cuz I couldn't use it #struggles
Kacey_Laine|I love being able to lay right in the middle of my bed 😍😴 #foreveralonebutthatsokaycuzitgivesmoreroomtosnuggle
Kacey_Laine|I'm watching the chipotle documentary to try and calm my brain enough to sleep. I don't know why this made sense in my brain.
Kacey_Laine|This. http://t.co/l8wrAWkhSw
Kacey_Laine|"""It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel."" John Mayer, you are perfection ❤️"
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Always my dear ❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes you just have to lay in bed and listen to John Mayer on repeat. Nothing else. Just that.
Kacey_Laine|@ayydubs I had an uber driver who legit thought I was a prostitute...don't ask why...but it happened.
Kacey_Laine|Thanks for the Amber Alert that had my phone nonstop buzzing. Just freaked me out a little 😐
Kacey_Laine|Convertible cars are a good idea until you mess up your hair that you spent an hour doing.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo is this a subtweet about me?
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo STUCK IN LOVE 😍😍 ITS AMAZING
Kacey_Laine|When you get ready and try to take a selfie for Instagram but everything is too ugly...life is a struggle 😐 http://t.co/cGL4cdIZFn
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo let's road trip.
Kacey_Laine|I deserve some kind of award. I have gotten myself out of bed and begun putting on makeup so I look semi presentable for society.
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie Eeeek!
Kacey_Laine|@Susy_Diana RIGHT?! I will have very limited wifi- so I'll be sure to pop on every so often to share any thoughts ;)
Kacey_Laine|And why is this month already so stressful? Trying to figure out my next 10 days before I'm on a week long cruise with no wifi [aka life].
Kacey_Laine|How is it already July?!
Kacey_Laine|Me. http://t.co/SduM4ZsyxC
Kacey_Laine|@MokisHome what time/where?
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan sending you lots of love my dear ❤️❤️❤️
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip We had people use out gymnastics center to train for that show 😂😂
Kacey_Laine|There's fire dancers here...what? #casualmondaynight
Kacey_Laine|“@chrisbharrison: West coast if you have a scarf phobia be careful watching tonight's #TheBachelorette it's #scarftastic” 😂😂😂
Kacey_Laine|@MokisHome I'm crashing it #noinvite
Kacey_Laine|VidCon weekend continues [apparently]. Headed to #YouTubeSpaceLA for a VidCon after party 🎉
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo 😂😂 silly goose
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Idk why that was such like a straight forward and serious response 😐 I miss youuuu
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo mine expires next month. I got a letter in the mail.

Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo [yes I'm going to keep replying to all your tweets until I get to see you and go on adventures]
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo no I'm here snuggled up in my bed.
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 get ready for an intense cuddle sesh 😍😍😍
Kacey_Laine|VidCon tomorrow. Who's ready?!? Me. Maybe.
Kacey_Laine|I hate LAX. Second time here this week 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|Okay wait. Finally finished watching last night's episode of The Bachelorette. Still confused...what's a pantsapreneur?
Kacey_Laine|Hi. That's all.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Not me. But like, I'm a cool person in CA. Does that count for anything?
Kacey_Laine|@glamourista16 @sarahbelle93 I have a problem. And I've accepted it.
Kacey_Laine|@glamourista16 @sarahbelle93 that is always a factor into any decision I make.
Kacey_Laine|My apartment smells like self tanner and clean laundry. Welcome to VidCon prep. Or just a normal day in my life...not really sure.
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy me.
Kacey_Laine|Also I'm incapable of planning outfits so I am packing my entire wardrobe and will most likely attend VidCon in footie pajamas.
Kacey_Laine|How many pairs of shoes do I need to pack for 4 days of VidCon? Obviously the answer is 12 😐
Kacey_Laine|Cuddle time...population: 2 [me &amp; John Mayer *on spotify]
Kacey_Laine|But like that mini man scarf, I would send him home for that. Who cares about a lie detector test... #TheBachelorette
Kacey_Laine|The Bachelorette gives me false hope for my love life. Why don't I get to wear pretty dresses, travel the world &amp; pick from 25 hot guys 😍😭
Kacey_Laine|Wait. Ed Sheeran's new album is actually perfect 😍😍
Kacey_Laine|Standing in my living room waiting for my self tanner to dry, while watching The Bachelorette #VidConprep
Kacey_Laine|Play trivia or watch ads on Hulu? I think we know the answer [also because I'm like really good at trivia...4/4!!]
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie yes!! And yayyy!! Happy almost birthday!!
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I wish I had blackout curtains so I could pretend it was dark and pass the bleep out 😴
Kacey_Laine|I really want it to be bedtime right now. Like please? I just want to sleep. It's not even that I'm that tired, I'm just like done.
Kacey_Laine|I have 48 hours of me time before the madness of VidCon. That means 48 hours of Netflix &amp; no pants. And cleaning. But mainly no pants.
Kacey_Laine|While cleaning my car I found a pair of high heels, many off campus passes from high school, &amp; countless Starbucks holders #me
Kacey_Laine|@TalkBeckyTalk yes!!! Can't wait to see you 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|@Susy_Diana awh thank you my love!! 😘❤️
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 @LandonAustin @glamourista16 @sarahbelle93 If it's anything like his normal dancing then yeah I'll take a pass
Kacey_Laine|@glamourista16 @LandonAustin @DaniAustin2 @sarahbelle93 #TwerkCon2014
Kacey_Laine|I'm in love with the Backstreet Boys. And Nick Carter's still kinda hot. I talk about it all in my new video. https://t.co/WdKerrrpcm
Kacey_Laine|Also I attempted to ride a goat and got yelled at by the petting zoo workers [all on video]. So I'd say I've had a pretty productive week.
Kacey_Laine|Now it's time to sleep, get some work done, clean my apartment, and prepare myself for the week ahead. VidCon...I'm ready for you [kinda].
Kacey_Laine|In the past 4 days I have been to Disneyland, the zoo, Santa Monica pier, and watched an entire season of Real Housewives #productive
Kacey_Laine|#VidCon2014 @sarahbelle93 @glamourista16 @DaniAustin2 Prepare yourselves ladies 👯✨ http://t.co/dHo8m61Qrr
Kacey_Laine|@Susy_Diana hahaha yeah was not ready to get into that conversation with a stranger.
Kacey_Laine|@brittanyybeach yeah they were first talking about viners and then they were shocked you can make money off YouTube. Hahah
Kacey_Laine|@Susy_Diana He started to throw out numbers and yearly salaries. I wanted badly to correct him, but I kept to myself. Hahahah
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 @LandonAustin @glamourista16 @DaniAustin2 Nightly wall twerking sessions!!
Kacey_Laine|Listening to a conversation at the table next to mine about how you can make money on YouTube...wait wuttt?! You can?!?
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 @glamourista16 we will make a twerking wall in the hotel. @DaniAustin2 better be prepared.
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 @glamourista16 YAHASSSS 😍😍
Kacey_Laine|@glamourista16 @sarahbelle93 Come find meeee #canwegetmexicanfoodthisweek #vidconroomies #goodvibes
Kacey_Laine|Going to a restaurant and automatically connecting to their wifi is kind of the greatest.
Kacey_Laine|@missglamorazzi @beautybaby44 waking up after a nap and having it still be bright out was the highlight of mine.
Kacey_Laine|USA 😍🇺🇸 [I'm not watching soccer...I just like America]
Kacey_Laine|It's a beautiful day in LA. I was outside for a little. Now I'm back in my apartment watching Real Housewives #seizetheday #butiwantalazyday
Kacey_Laine|My future home 💗✨ http://t.co/DMC90A3r1S
Kacey_Laine|Was it a mistake to come to Santa Monica on a Sunday during summer? Probably. But did I do it anyways? Yes.
Kacey_Laine|In bed by 11pm. I know, I know...I really need to control my partying. I just can't help it. I'm a social butterfly.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo no but you can hang out with me in LA and then visit norcal #bestofbothworlds
Kacey_Laine|I like to think that my binge watching of Real Housewives is good preparation for actual real life socialization #somuchdrama
Kacey_Laine|What do normal people do on a Saturday night? Probably watch a 20 minute knife demo at the grocery store. Or at least that's what I did.
Kacey_Laine|@LilyLaneMusic yes please! I'll DM you my number! 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|@LilyLaneMusic ah that is such a gorgeous view 😍 ps how long are you here for?!
Kacey_Laine|Obvies it's a raging Saturday night for my best friend and I. We've spent the last 3 hours on my couch watching Real Housewives #partyinLA

Kacey_Laine|Laying in bed while my mind goes a mile a minute. Fwennddzzz. Talk to meeeee 😩😭🐒
Kacey_Laine|These Desperate Housewives have more of a love life in one episode, than I ever do.
Kacey_Laine|I'm in a constant struggle between wanting friends and hating all people. I apologize to anybody I ever interact with.
Kacey_Laine|All I wanna do is sleep for a billion hours and never have to deal with people ever again.
Kacey_Laine|I don't follow sports or watch soccer, but I like America...#goUSA #notnecessarilyinsoccerbutinlife 🇺🇸❤️✨
Kacey_Laine|My best friend is coming to stay with me in LA for 5 days! What are some fun things we have to do in LA?? 👯🎉

Kacey_Laine|Selfies by myself because I have no friends #whowantstohangoutwithme #sorryimaghost 👻🐒 http://t.co/HSbWArIRoV
Kacey_Laine|I have multiple burns on my leg from straightening my hair. How that even happens, I don't know. But I think my hair is getting too long.
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 @ellefowler 😂😂 yeah that would make more sense
Kacey_Laine|"@ellefowler I read this as ""dear running man, I've missed you"". I was feeling it, classic 90s dance move."
Kacey_Laine|Me doing my makeup right now http://t.co/oszyKpzEfW
Kacey_Laine|"And I like how I say I'm seeing ""real people"" today...😐 I'm sorry my whole life revolves around the internet."
Kacey_Laine|I'm supposed to see real people tonight but I'm really enjoying laying in bed watching RHOBH right now. Like their drama is enough for me.
Kacey_Laine|@RADeMita happy birthday pretty girl!!
Kacey_Laine|I have way too many Toddlers and Tiaras pictures on my phone. You know, just so I am always relatable.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo you look like a mermaid and I love it. Your hair (and you I guess) look flawless 😍 #nowmovetolaandhangoutwithmeallthetime
Kacey_Laine|@JeanineAmapola jealous 😍
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo my constant question.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo at least you made it out of the car...driving circles around the neighborhood isn't too good for making friends...😐
Kacey_Laine|@JacobGann it's good! You gotta come visit!
Kacey_Laine|@JacobGann hiii how are you?
Kacey_Laine|I woke up at 2am, drove 6 hours &amp; proceeded to get through the day. Let's just say I'm ready to pass out now #partyanimal #10pmtimeforbed
Kacey_Laine|Excuse me while I go cry by myself because this is too precious and I'm too alone 😭😍 http://t.co/zQ3uYGVE4q
Kacey_Laine|@brittanyybeach I won't be having a meet up but I will be hanging around the whole time ☺️
Kacey_Laine|@brittanyybeach yes!!
Kacey_Laine|@LexieLoz I loveee the new one! I don't think I've actually watched the original but the new one is one of my top movies!! 😍
Kacey_Laine|Large groups of choreographed dancing makes me so happy. Like it's sad the amount of joy it brings me 😍
Kacey_Laine|@ellefowler new one!! Love itttt 😍😍
Kacey_Laine|Footloose is on TV 😍 My love for choreographed dance is so real [also a cute southern boy helps] #butiwannadanceeee
Kacey_Laine|I'm not good at surprises but I'd say this one was pretty successful 👯❤️ http://t.co/k7XWBvM4sp

Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo ohmygoodness you look perfect &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo WAIT. I DID THIS YESTERDAY. Like I don't know how but I felt stupid. I'm glad I'm not alone.
Kacey_Laine|Going off 2 hours of sleep. Is it nap time yet?
Kacey_Laine|The last hour of my drive has included a Backstreet Boys sing-a-long. I blame waking up at 2am [and my major love for 90s boybands].
Kacey_Laine|Where the sun and the moon share the sky. That's my favorite ☼☽ http://t.co/eq4LKkJdBt
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood very soon. But don't get too excited-it's not really YouTube related. Hahah just kacey being sneaky 😁
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood trying to go to a super secret place too 😏 #kaceyonlygetsupthisearlyforspecialthings
Kacey_Laine|Up bright and early for a super secret project that I'll be able to tell y'all about later today! 😏😘 http://t.co/oTze5yLCqb
Kacey_Laine|Only in LA can there be completely stopped traffic at 4am. Also, why am I awake right now?
Kacey_Laine|HELP. Netflix changed their logo and look and now I'm very confused/feel like they're tricking me...
Kacey_Laine|Photo booth fun with @PennyChic 😘🎉 #whyistherenoparrotemoji #Jajajajamaica @CallitSpring http://t.co/xoaL8Jlgni
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 I got your back babyboo ;) Now get your booty to lala land.
Kacey_Laine|Y'all would be proud of me. I got ready and went to 2 events tonight. Yay for Kacey being [somewhat] social.
Kacey_Laine|What more could I ask for? Diet Coke and nail polish 😍💅 Having fun at the @JulepMaven event!! http://t.co/87y2oINJrU
Kacey_Laine|@AllieMarieEvans she is my favorite. And this picture is precious 😍
Kacey_Laine|I have so much to do today and I should have done some of it yesterday but I didn't and now I'm majorly regretting it #struggles
Kacey_Laine|@maddislifee so fierce babygirl &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|OKAY! Going to be filming a Questions with Kacey today so we can have some time to chat!! Send in your questions NOW! #QuestionswithKacey
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz what's sad is that it happens often 😖 people these days!!
Kacey_Laine|"If you are sending a business email, maybe think about writing out the word ""please"" instead of just ""plz""...just a thought."
Kacey_Laine|7:30am is not too early for Diet Coke. Don't try to tell me any differently.
Kacey_Laine|About to pass the bleep out. Legit so tired but now [apparently] would be a *great* time to have a panic attack about life #no #goawaylife
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes you have to shut off your brain and escape all your stresses. It's a cuddle up with Netflix kind of night.
Kacey_Laine|15 days until @VidCon!! Who will be there?? I will [kind of]...I will be in Anaheim but still need to find a ticket #oops #iprocrastinated 😁
Kacey_Laine|My brain does not want to work and I have so much to plan and figure out. So today is not working out at all. Help.
Kacey_Laine|@MissJenFABULOUS When I saw her in February she did and I kinda died 😍🇺🇸
Kacey_Laine|It's 12:40pm. I just woke up. I guess I needed to sleep 😷😴 Now to get up and be somewhat productive.
Kacey_Laine|So I guess I'm not sleeping tonight. I love getting sick right before I go to bed 😷🔫 #sarcasm
Kacey_Laine|I don't like people. Like they all suck. Sorry.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I love basketball so yes.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo sorry. That was me.
Kacey_Laine|@meghanrosette boys suck. We know this.
Kacey_Laine|No. I don't wanna play. And I apologize to @meghanrosette's neighbors for our screaming #PrettyLittleLiars
Kacey_Laine|True life: my dad's addicted to The Bachelorette. His follow up text was that he needed to catch up on last weeks. http://t.co/DMYf6EzAVI
Kacey_Laine|It's almost Pretty Little Liars time. Which means it's time to refresh my brain on what happened last season #soexcited #PLL
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 #blessed
Kacey_Laine|I walked to go pick up my dinner. Now that means I can eat my weight in Mexican food, right?
Kacey_Laine|@hlkarraker so great meeting you my dear!! ❤️
Kacey_Laine|If you are ever sad, just know that you weren't me at 13 #transformationtuesday #sotrendy #soLA #why http://t.co/2Sa56mkxEo

Kacey_Laine|All I want to do today is lay in bed and watch Desperate Housewives.
Kacey_Laine|HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY FAVORITE SOUTHERN BELLE, @SARAHBELLE93 ❤️🎉 #yassss
Kacey_Laine|You don't know true panic until there's a bee stuck in your room and you're in the middle of painting your nails #helpless #whyme
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 well good thing I'll be seeing you soon 😏😘
Kacey_Laine|LA. I'm back. Did you miss me?
Kacey_Laine|5:00am and I'm on the road. See you soon Los Angeles.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I just can't step away from the drama.
Kacey_Laine|I really should be asleep based on the fact that I have to be driving at 5am. But watching Desperate Housewives seems like a better idea.
Kacey_Laine|@RachelTalbott Wait that's actually amazing.
Kacey_Laine|Driving back to LA at 5am tomorrow morning. But I got to see my friends from home tonight, so I'm happy.
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood I usually do that but I figured I should try and be an adult and use the iron while I'm home...never again.
Kacey_Laine|Just a tip, since I'm a functioning adult and all...don't try and iron clothes while they're still on your body.
Kacey_Laine|@KalebNation @bfftaylor Congratulations!! So glad to have met last weekend! Wishing y'all the best! ❤️
Kacey_Laine|I'm helping my dad put together his dresser and he said he needed to get a ratchet. I was confused. Obviously I do this a lot.
Kacey_Laine|Time for cuddles with the bae. Aka Netflix #idontneedlove #ihatemyselfforsayingbae #neveragain
Kacey_Laine|"I think on my drive back to LA, I'm going to have a sign on my car that says ""Looking for friends in LA...hmu bb"". It's a solid idea."
Kacey_Laine|Today marks 2 years since I graduated high school. The thing I miss is always being around friends. Now I have to like...go meet new people.
Kacey_Laine|And as much as I say that I hate people. I really don't [usually]. Interacting with people is good. Friends are good.
Kacey_Laine|All I've done tonight is stalk social media. I know I should connect with real life people, but it's kinda the same thing [except not].
Kacey_Laine|Wait. This may have been written by me. It wasn't...but sadly, it could have been. http://t.co/6A1SACz8xu
Kacey_Laine|Once again I'm really impressed with my crafting ability. I would show y'all. But it's for a present. So I can't. But trust me.
Kacey_Laine|"I'm a published author. Check it out at Barnes &amp; Noble. It's called 'The Sad Unicorn and The Girl"". http://t.co/DfkbzkTfkv"
Kacey_Laine|Y'all are invited to my birthday party. The invitations were homemade. With our brand new computer. http://t.co/7bimRsvIf6
Kacey_Laine|I found my mom's yearbook from her freshman year in high school. She was way cooler than I will ever be. http://t.co/6Ch4xBuoQo
Kacey_Laine|Time to get blood drawn #fun #partytime
Kacey_Laine|I want to go see The Fault in Our Stars but I don't know if I'm ready to cry that much 😭😭
Kacey_Laine|Don't ever be scared to honestly say I love you.  You never know what an impact it can have.
Kacey_Laine|Going to sleep tonight, I realize it's just the start of another year w/o you. But looking back I was blessed to have 17 years with you ❤️
Kacey_Laine|So all in all, I was an excellent story teller and speller. And art was a specialty of mine. This is Humpy the Camel. http://t.co/OCU7D2bqtj
Kacey_Laine|"I had a poppin love life at age 4/5. Found a journal entry about me &amp; my boyfriend. ""Kacey sed ""marry me?"" He sed ""shur if u move to Africa"""
Kacey_Laine|"Quoted from a story I wrote, age 5- [boy couldn't find a girl] ""A butuful girl went by, he sterd at her until he sed hey girl. The end"" 😐"
Kacey_Laine|@LacyCavalier @LukeBryanOnline IM LIKE ACTUALLY DYING 😍😭 getting on my private jet to Nashville right now.
Kacey_Laine|"""She continues to prefer less physical activity to more fantasy activity"" My teachers' way of saying she's lazy 😂"
Kacey_Laine|"I found observation papers from me in preschool. Apparently I had a ""balanced relationship w/ her 'special buddy'"" aka my boyfriend 😘 #flirt"
Kacey_Laine|Will forever be one of the hardest days of the year. The anniversary of my mother's passing, as well… http://t.co/rY1FZTwWjf
Kacey_Laine|I want to say thank you for all of your love &amp; support today. I wouldn't have been able to make it through these last 3 years without y'all.
Kacey_Laine|Three years ago, I never would have imagined my life to be as it is today. I want to say thank y'all for your support through it all &lt;3
Kacey_Laine|I burnt my popcorn 😭
Kacey_Laine|It's scary how all these long days have quickly turned into three years.
Kacey_Laine|Seriously so proud of the wonderful @PennyChic! I am so blessed to know &amp; work with such an inspirational woman &lt;3 http://t.co/e5Xk2ZRXcx
Kacey_Laine|"""Where do you even go to tweet? What do you say? I'd just say tweet tweet, like a bird"" - my dad, aka the next Twitter celebrity."
Kacey_Laine|So proud of the lovely @missglamorazzi on her show, #Threads! 😘❤️ http://t.co/iVENvuLf6D
Kacey_Laine|There is no greater feeling than getting the opportunity to watch a movie trailer on Hulu, &amp; then skip ads the rest of the show #blessed
Kacey_Laine|Also, I def feel that Marquel has been friend-zoned. I don't blame her though, I'd wanna be friends with cookie guy. #TheBachelorette
Kacey_Laine|Before my dad asked how LA has been, he wanted me to catch him up on the latest drama on The Bachelorette.
Kacey_Laine|Home means free food and fast wifi 😍
Kacey_Laine|• homeward bound • @ middle of nowhere, california http://t.co/u9rPcXhmwq
Kacey_Laine|7am and 250 miles to go.
Kacey_Laine|It's too early to be awake.
Kacey_Laine|@BisousOfBliss WHY AM I NOT THERE???
Kacey_Laine|4:30am wake up call. But at least that means I'm that much closer to getting outta LA 😭❤️
Kacey_Laine|Favorite part of my California road trip? 8 hours of country music. I can pretend I live in the south with a sexy guy [hint: Luke Bryan 😏😘]
Kacey_Laine|I go through phases where I'll be social for a few days &amp; then hibernate for forever. Aka won't be seeing people anytime soon #imsocial #not
Kacey_Laine|"Woke up feeling sick. Blehhh. Taking it easy today &amp; packing my stuff so I can make the drive home tomorrow. Can't wait to be ""home home"" :)"
Kacey_Laine|@meghanrosette Come back to America so we can go to Disneyland 😍 ps. have fun
Kacey_Laine|I get super emotional watching competition shows. Currently watching So You Think You Can Dance auditions and I've cried multiple times 😭🙈
Kacey_Laine|@kayleymelissa Thank you so much Kayley &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|With the 3 year anniversary of my mom's passing coming up this week, I need just a little break to refocus myself. Hope y'all understand ❤️
Kacey_Laine|Wanted to let y'all know that I will be taking this week off from uploading in order to spend time w/ family &amp; have a little me time...
Kacey_Laine|I started to do an at home workout so I have an interval timer going that beeps every minute. I've been laying on my floor the last 5 beeps.
Kacey_Laine|I hate getting phone calls from unknown numbers who don't leave voicemails. Like just no.
Kacey_Laine|All I wanna do is crawl into bed and sleep forever. So tired but had fun at GenBeauty this weekend! Loved getting to meet some of y'all!!
Kacey_Laine|GenBeauty Day 2 today! And I will be at the LUSH Cosmetics booth at 1:30! Come by and we can pretty much be best friends forever.
Kacey_Laine|@aspynovard IT WAS AMAZING. @DaniAustin2 and I went on Thursday!! 😍🎉 #BSBforever

Kacey_Laine|"Only I would go to Nordstrom the morning of an event to get last minute ""necessities""."
Kacey_Laine|Good morning beautiful sunshine ☀️ Getting ready for GenBeauty today!! Who will I be seeing there?! #GenBeauty ❤️💄✨
Kacey_Laine|Just woke up &amp; my neighbors are playing country music so loud. Like I can hear it through my bedroom walls. Not complaining. Just saying.
Kacey_Laine|Just realized I didn't tweet at all today. So here I am. Hi. I'm alive.
Kacey_Laine|"@MsMeghanMakeup maybe like a white van that says ""free candy"" on the outside...😏🍭"
Kacey_Laine|"@michellexxo ""how to be a real life person"""
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo is that not what most people do?
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Ha I love you way too much. And yesss. Next couple weeks are weird/busy for me but we will make it work.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Hi. I miss you. Okay. Bye. http://t.co/xQNtwz9gzR
Kacey_Laine|Literally so tired. But I'm watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians on Netflix and apparently that's more important than sleep.
Kacey_Laine|But actually, this may have been the best night of my life • w/ @DaniAustin2 and @backstreetboys 😍 http://t.co/C2r0ziOplP
Kacey_Laine|Choreographed dancing makes everything better.

Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood Got the front office people to let me in!!
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 if we ever can get into my apartment or car...
Kacey_Laine|We were going to go for a hike but then I locked us out of my apartment and car. This is why I don't exercise.
Kacey_Laine|PSA. We would like to confirm that the rumors are true. @DaniAustin2 and I will be attending the Backstreet Boys concert tonight.
Kacey_Laine|HEY. Who will be at GenBeauty this weekend?? I'll be there. So we should like meet and hang out and have fun and whatever else people do.
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood Only for @DaniAustin2 would I suffer through LAX 😏😘
Kacey_Laine|@ClaudiaSulewski Yes. This. Yes.
Kacey_Laine|Now to deal with the adventure that is LAX #favoriteplaceever
Kacey_Laine|"One of my many talents includes texting my sister vague spoiler updates on TV shows she doesn't watch. Currently: Scandal- ""VPs a murderer."""
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 YASSSSS 😍🎉
Kacey_Laine|Laying in bed searching through Yelp to try and find good Mexican food. @DaniAustin2- my goal while you're here is to find the best. [1DAY🎉]
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan @DaniAustin2 love youu 😘❤️
Kacey_Laine|You don't know a real life struggle until you try to put self tanner on your back by yourself.
Kacey_Laine|I spilled a bottle of nail polish all over my bed. I'm more upset about the nail polish being gone then my bedding being ruined.
Kacey_Laine|I did a little bit [a lot] of shopping • New haul is up on http://t.co/NxHypAq5lx #thehuntapp http://t.co/B9POYohphQ http://t.co/KfRPA40muW

Kacey_Laine|I think I may have just bought 3 phone cases off Amazon. Maybe 4. They were glittery. So of course I needed them.
Kacey_Laine|Man sandals. No. I can't 🙈 #TheBachelorette #butinreallifetoo #justno

Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo yeah and one more question. How come no guy ever likes me? 😭😐

Kacey_Laine|Watching movies after taking NyQuil is interesting. I keep falling asleep and then I make up my own storyline to fill in what I missed 😴💤
Kacey_Laine|"I'm just waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come out and be like ""You're on my new MTV show and you've been punk'd. Your whole life is a joke!!"""
Kacey_Laine|Just got my new phone case I ordered off Etsy and I'm so disappointed. It's no where close to what I wanted and not what was described :(((
Kacey_Laine|Stuck in bed feeling like death. What a great way to spend this wonderful Friday 😐
Kacey_Laine|I FOUND MY PHONE 😍😭😁🎉🙏🐒
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood I FOUND IT!!! Your tweet to me lit up my phone so I saw it!!!!
Kacey_Laine|I just emailed my sister to call my phone to see if I can find it. Now here's hoping she checks Twitter so she knows to check her email...
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood It's on silent :(((( I can't even use emojis to show how distraught I am. Hahaha
Kacey_Laine|I lost my phone somewhere in my apartment. I don't know what to do now...

Kacey_Laine|@ayydubs Okay. I'm getting in my car now. I'll be there in a few days #roadtriptime #kaceydrivestoNYC #livetweetingthisroadtrip

Kacey_Laine|The Bachelorette doesn't come on until 9:30. That means I have to stay awake until 9:30. Can I take a nap now? #imanoldperson

Kacey_Laine|Good morning sunshine.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo That reminded me to check mine, and I got one toooooooo :))))) Come visit me and let's get our free treats.
Kacey_Laine|Saturday night is reserved for catching up on Scandal...right?
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip I've been doing laundry for 5 hours. I don't think I'm allowed to be called a grownup.
Kacey_Laine|Hey, @Kristin_Ess! Sent you a DM, would love to chat about potentially working together to update my hair [and of course show YouTube ;)]
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter hotmail...duhhh #becauseimhot
Kacey_Laine|"""E-Mail My Heart"" from Britney's first album &lt;33 That's all I want in life...email me back and say our love will stay alive."
Kacey_Laine|@briareece Ah yessss love that mall!!
Kacey_Laine|@briareece ...went a lot as easy family trips and we'd just lay out at the pool, go shopping, explore, that sort of thing :)
Kacey_Laine|@briareece Hahaha right?!? Everybody's always like what do you do there?? Most of the times were for gymnastics competitions but we also...
Kacey_Laine|Fun fact about me: I'm obsessed with Las Vegas. Like legit, love it. Been over 15 times. Like why aren't I there now? Who wants to roadtrip?
Kacey_Laine|@mere_follow thank you so much darling!! You are too sweet 😘😘

Kacey_Laine|Is YouTube still having issues? I have a new video for y'all but wanna make sure you'll actually be able to get it #getittogetheryoutube
Kacey_Laine|My favorite part of waking up Saturday morning is being able to watch last night's episode of Shark Tank [I'm only slightly obsessed] 🐋
Kacey_Laine|@CaryCheyenneXO ahhh I'm so excited!!!!
Kacey_Laine|Why is the FedEx man here at 9:30 at night? I'm obviously answering the door with no pants...#sorrynotsorry #ijustwantmyshoes
Kacey_Laine|Friday night is party night. Kidding. I just finished season 1 of Nashville. Like I'm sorry, this show is really good. Imma keep watching.
Kacey_Laine|@alliekat815 Like so so good!!! I'm obsessed.
Kacey_Laine|I love that moment when you are watching a TV show and you become so emotionally invested in it [currently dying while watching Nashville]
Kacey_Laine|I've been editing a video and I thought it was dark out until I realized my shades are just closed. It's still light. Not bedtime yet.
Kacey_Laine|I can't tell if I'm getting sick or just tired of being around people. But I'm absolutely exhausted. Friday night will be spent w/ Netflix.
Kacey_Laine|It's been 17 hours since my last tweet. Hi.
Kacey_Laine|9:30pm means bedtime. Like I've said before, I'm a really good old person.
Kacey_Laine|&amp;&amp;even though it's no where close to the romanticized dream I came out here for, I love it. It's reality. It's trying to make it. It's life.
Kacey_Laine|LA is not the glam city of dreams. It's scattered lights out the window, my May 2011 playlist on repeat, wearing nothing but an old tshirt.
Kacey_Laine|My room constantly smells like hairspray. I'm not complaining, just stating a fact.
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter truer words have never been spoken.
Kacey_Laine|Everybody loves a good haul. http://t.co/5CAwj49B3Y
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood WAIT WHAT?! They have burritos and cookies???? Where is this magical place??
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood @DaniAustin2 I thought this just said burritos. I was like yes, my favorite cookie is a burrito too. Because I like burritos 😁
Kacey_Laine|I don't know how to use the AC in my apartment so I'm sitting in my car because it has working air conditioning #adult
Kacey_Laine|@chwelsea @KalelKitten 😓😓 I choose to live in California for the mild weather and lack of seasons. Not this 100 degree junk!! #dying
Kacey_Laine|Can I #TBT to last night at the Sprinkles cupcake ATM? Because that was a good idea. http://t.co/A0gPVHqAVO
Kacey_Laine|Please don't try and make conversation with me on the elevator. Especially by making a joke that I can't text on the elevator...😐
Kacey_Laine|Cool, iPhone. I was thinking the same thing 😐 http://t.co/D9kEB606VX
Kacey_Laine|I am dedicating today to cleaning and organizing my closet. Wish me luck.
Kacey_Laine|I come up with really good Shark Tank worthy ideas late at night. Then I look back at them in the morning &amp; they aren't even English #oops
Kacey_Laine|After hanging out with @AprilLockhart tonight I've just further confirmed the fact that I need to visit Nashville. Like asap.
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip @AprilLockhart it's like actually perfect. Cupcakes and no human interaction. What more do I want in life?
Kacey_Laine|We have arrived 😍 @AprilLockhart http://t.co/Q0eZkliFos
Kacey_Laine|Pizza time with @AprilLockhart 😍🍕 #soLA http://t.co/SaIU7ThOTp

Kacey_Laine|I'm getting antsy to post my new video. Currently have it scheduled for 4pm PST. What do we think...do we want it earlier??
Kacey_Laine|A new video will be going up today! Have you seen my most recent ones?! Make sure you're all caught up!! http://t.co/6cOkQ1F1qk
Kacey_Laine|@AlexGMusic7 Hey gorgeous! Absolutely loving the new song! Was wondering if I could perhaps use it in an upcoming tutorial? Thank you! &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|For those of you who didn't know, I am the new Miss USA. Surprise http://t.co/29yqetabv7 http://t.co/ZtTsQaPuFX
Kacey_Laine|This is the first time my Internet has semi-cooperated when I need it to. I feel like I should take advantage of this magical day.
Kacey_Laine|@hellokatyxo My life in a tweet.
Kacey_Laine|4:30am. That's still a real thing in this world. Good to know.
Kacey_Laine|In bed and ready to sleep by 10:30pm. And this is like late for me. I'm really good at being an old person #19goingon90
Kacey_Laine|Just got home from the @BenefitBeauty launch event for the #realfineliner. Seriously, y'all are going to love it #eyelinergamesostrong
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz etsy!
Kacey_Laine|I got ready and I'm wearing color. That doesn't sound like me 😐 [but I'm not wearing pants, so that's chill] http://t.co/vtQOxwLOZS
Kacey_Laine|@LandonAustin you mean pink and rhinestones isn't manly??
Kacey_Laine|Me in art form. Pink, rhinestones, America, and California. Kacey is getting crafty. http://t.co/yqTJ1dBHkk
Kacey_Laine|This is what inspired my desire to be on Shark Tank. http://t.co/VQKhiJ3BV5 I have the song on my iPod.
Kacey_Laine|@beautybaby44 I'm crying 😂😂😂
Kacey_Laine|I need to get my hair redone. Going through Pinterest and dying because I want perfect Pinterest-y hair. Need to find a hairstylist in LA.
Kacey_Laine|@beautybaby44 @kristeevetter Wait. That is actually perfect.
Kacey_Laine|Sneak peek to Wednesday's makeup tutorial which resulted in a surplus of selfies #onlykindasorry http://t.co/8nUaXBCj2E
Kacey_Laine|I couldn't think of an inspirational quote to accompany my selfie. http://t.co/kn25nyOKyw http://t.co/av8jke7DDF
Kacey_Laine|Hulu gave me the option to watch The Fault in Our Stars trailer instead of ads throughout the show. Now I'm crying, but I have no ads.
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves Hahahah if that's what you wanna call it.
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie @RachhLoves PRECIOUS!!
Kacey_Laine|@Michelle_Potter Ooh thank you so much for letting me know!! Gotta go fix that!
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves I went through my phases. And only for you, would I let this resurface onto the Internet. http://t.co/cTNab4lFyl
Kacey_Laine|I spilled rhinestones all over my floor. Someone help. This is why I shouldn't be allowed to craft.
Kacey_Laine|@RachhLoves she's a little mini kacey :) but way more adorable than I ever was.
Kacey_Laine|@TheDeeSebial hiiii
Kacey_Laine|@MissLovelyLayla I think they have it all! I'm only on season 1 but they got it!! And yesss
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan you gotta keep your chin up. Radiate positivity &amp; it will come back, you attract what you give off. I know you can do it ❤️
Kacey_Laine|@MissLovelyLayla right?!? I've been wanting to start it for forever then just realized they have all of it on Hulu plus!!
Kacey_Laine|Currently bedazzling a canvas and watching Nashville (which I just started...LOVE). Hope y'all are having a good Monday!
Kacey_Laine|One Tree Hill is the only acceptable way to end a day.
Kacey_Laine|I just want to say thank y'all for your love and support today. It really does mean the world to me ♡♡♡
Kacey_Laine|I wish I had just one more day. To say thank you, to say I'm sorry, and to say I love you. http://t.co/2Z6Jg8Cwj6 http://t.co/cyKLvDtJbc
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie inspires me to always keep going, so thank you for that. I love you darling &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie Thank you so much, Angie &lt;3 I am sending you so much love this Mother's Day. You have always so supportive and positive, it really
Kacey_Laine|Actually cannot stay awake any longer.
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip ah just saw this. LOVE.
Kacey_Laine|“@meghanrosette: Raging on a Saturday night! And by raging I mean I stayed at the mall until it closed” #wegohard
Kacey_Laine|Side note: @meghanrosette's apartment has good pillows. Like they're perfectly snuggly and I can just sit and cuddle with them.
Kacey_Laine|Shirtless Zac Efron. Yes please. Again.
Kacey_Laine|Zac Efron. Yes please.
Kacey_Laine|SURPRISE! New video is LIVE! May 2014: Questions with Kacey ♥ http://t.co/qMel765JdO
Kacey_Laine|Less than an hour...http://t.co/PwL5cK43P7
Kacey_Laine|The sky's awake, so I'm awake! http://t.co/0V2dnD1F9T
Kacey_Laine|It's 4:30am. Again, someone please tell me why I'm awake?
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip @ZacEfron when he asks for my number I'll just say for any questions to contact lisa@bigfra.me #moderndayromance
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip @ZacEfron stop it 😭 he better be there tomorrow when I go. &amp; he better sit next to me. &amp; fall in love with me. Too much to ask?
Kacey_Laine|Why am I not a Disney princess?
Kacey_Laine|How does any 19 year old girl spend a Friday night? Watching Frozen. Don't lie to me.
Kacey_Laine|Question! For tutorials, do y'all like a voiceover or just music playing?? Trying to figure out what would be best...
Kacey_Laine|My neighbors are being really loud right now. I guess it's time to blast Backstreet Boys on repeat [although that's not punishment].
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood I'm good! Been crafting all day now settling in with some dinner and going to do some editing :) How are you?!
Kacey_Laine|Hi.
Kacey_Laine|@itsbecccaslife yes!!
Kacey_Laine|This sums up my great desire to be southern. And artsy. Neither of which I am. http://t.co/hRH2UlwQXn
Kacey_Laine|I love getting up before the suns fully up. But, can I go back to sleep? 😴💤
Kacey_Laine|@LacyCavalier we'll just be prepping for #tourlife aka you actually being on tour, me being there too...
Kacey_Laine|@LacyCavalier Like without a doubt, it's happening. Watch out, Nashville...Lacy and Kacey will be at it again.
Kacey_Laine|What am I doing at 10:30 on a Thursday night? Looking up flights to Nashville. It's happening. Not sure when, but I'll be there.
Kacey_Laine|"I hate seeing the ""RT for no finals"" tweets. We used to have to talk our way out of taking tests [don't do that kids...education is good]."
Kacey_Laine|@_luisavaz Awh you are too sweet :))
Kacey_Laine|@amarixe Oh but of course. Obvies we were the cool kids...
Kacey_Laine|I told myself I was done working at 6. It's now 9 and I'm still editing a video for next week. Oops?
Kacey_Laine|@amarixe Also, that mark on my cheek...yeah that's a scar from a sky dancer doll #yay90s
Kacey_Laine|@amarixe Oooh girl. Your choice was a much classier look than mine. I really was into fashion as you could see... http://t.co/ZaQ9Phr1r7
Kacey_Laine|I talk about being a Pinterest addict, my love for black eyeliner, and cute country boys. Go ahead, you can watch. https://t.co/654cGsXsG8
Kacey_Laine|Throwing it back to yesterday. http://t.co/cXXtkIuuPC http://t.co/1wnwD6btqb
Kacey_Laine|The stage of self tanning where you are too lazy to redo it so now you look diseased. That is me #thestruggle
Kacey_Laine|@haleytush Like actually though.
Kacey_Laine|Watching Netflix gives me a false sense of having friends. It may be a problem.
Kacey_Laine|After a certain time, my brain just shuts off. Tonight that time was 10:30 pm. I'm done. Goodbye.
Kacey_Laine|Mexican food and CVS at 10pm. That's what normal people do on a Wednesday night, right?
Kacey_Laine|@meghanrosette oh heyyyy. I saw that. In person.
Kacey_Laine|@KelseyCWFan99 ah no way!! I love that show!!
Kacey_Laine|@SkylarDayne ahhh so pretty!!!! Miss youuuu 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan ahhh no! Tweet them with #QuestionsWithKacey and I'll save them for next time!!
Kacey_Laine|@meghanrosette I'm coming to you. Slowly. Thanks Obama.
Kacey_Laine|In stopped traffic and saw someone get out of their car to get a CD from the trunk. Thank you Spotify for never making me be that person.
Kacey_Laine|Country music just makes me so happy. Like I love it. A lot.
Kacey_Laine|@LacyCavalier I'm coming to Nashville. Like yesterday. Like I need to book a flight and come hang out with you asap.
Kacey_Laine|Okay!! Time to film! Send in your questions for #QuestionsWithKacey! GO GO GO!

Kacey_Laine|@katelynndubow @iaunplug Love how this turned out and the photos are amazing!! Had so much fun working with y'all!!
Kacey_Laine|I'm filming my monthly Q&amp;A today!! Tweet me your questions [ #QuestionsWithKacey ] Ask away!
Kacey_Laine|So like sleep...that's a thing, right?
Kacey_Laine|@MsBrittanybrat @yestarawood I don't like it. I'd rather have just diet coke. But they usually use it to show what is diet and not.
Kacey_Laine|@MsBrittanybrat @yestarawood they do that all the time here! Is that not a thing?? Hahah
Kacey_Laine|We're eating outside. It's raining. I'm not happy. Neither is @michellexxo. http://t.co/36fSqtFkxC
Kacey_Laine|@peacefromhalle Thank you &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|The new @HunterHayes' album is out. Please don't bother me for the next hour.
Kacey_Laine|Everything in my life has led up to this moment. http://t.co/xytB5vnKJH
Kacey_Laine|"""I know a lot of Olive Garden fun facts"". Yes that is a statement I just made to someone over text. And I wonder why I have no friends..."
Kacey_Laine|@kayleymelissa Eeeek can't wait!!
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 @FLAGALine Currently listening to them. Casual.
Kacey_Laine|@ardenrose186 literally yes.
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip I don't even know. But the fact you went all the way through Twitter till yesterday morning impresses me #goodwerk
Kacey_Laine|I hope my neighbors like listening to Luke Bryan on repeat. #illshakeitforyou #imreallysorry #butimreallynot 😘🇺🇸✨
Kacey_Laine|Wait. But actually though. I'm really impressed at my art skill. Okay I'm done. Bye.
Kacey_Laine|My attempt at art. http://t.co/RKcbNNmGzM http://t.co/VdZdDzwJwU
Kacey_Laine|Actual perfection 😍😍😍 “@styledotcom: IRL Barbie &amp; Ken. NBD. #MetGala http://t.co/JtVPlocjhE”
Kacey_Laine|I love how I think I'm crafty. So much so that I'll actually go and buy stuff to craft, and then realize I have no such talent...
Kacey_Laine|I let my hair dry in French braids overnight and I just took it out to put it in a ponytail &amp; now I look like a poodle. Like no thank you 😐
Kacey_Laine|“@payday1234: @Kacey_Laine favorites video?! IM NOT GOOD AT GUESSING GAMES” Winner, winner!! 😘🎉🏆
Kacey_Laine|"""I'm like actually obsessed with this""- said a billion times within 10 minutes. Any guesses on what I'm editing?"
Kacey_Laine|Wait. But actually, this smells like heaven 😍 http://t.co/5gkCP4BF6k
Kacey_Laine|This morning it was physically impossible to get me out of bed. Like I just did not want to move at all.
Kacey_Laine|One of those days where you just want to bury yourself in your blankets and sleep forever.
Kacey_Laine|Currently crying from the response from y'all. I am so blessed to have you in my life. Thank you &lt;3 https://t.co/5M4PTs5fcu
Kacey_Laine|Honestly, I love getting to do what I do because of you guys. And the fact that I don't have to wear pants. But mainly you guys.
Kacey_Laine|Wait. I'm kind of in love. http://t.co/LebvaY55eP
Kacey_Laine|Ha. Kidding. I'm just filming. #yallthoughtiwasmissusa #isthatanormalhashtag #probably #KaceyforMissUSA http://t.co/wdzbught6t

Kacey_Laine|I've got a surplus of selfies #selfiesunday #whynot http://t.co/38gQWpNgaZ
Kacey_Laine|@MakeupbyMandy24 uhmmm right?? 😍
Kacey_Laine|Who needs a boyfriend holding your hand when you have @meghanrosette grabbing your arm the whole movie. http://t.co/OMeTeA2HMT
Kacey_Laine|Watching Spider-Man. Can I be Emma Stone?
Kacey_Laine|"In a very ""I hate people"" mood right now. But then again, when am I not...oops."
Kacey_Laine|The UPS man just asked me if I can take my neighbor's packages and give it to them #no #thatsyourjob #butreallyno #idontknowmyneighbors
Kacey_Laine|@Nicholelyn13 Yes I think so!! It's like a jewelry tray or something, but I just keep my perfumes on it :) It's so cute. I'm obsessed. Hahah
Kacey_Laine|I like to pretend I'm classy. In reality, I only set this up so I could Instagram it. http://t.co/WbpQG25sRr http://t.co/LEdnduPR8z
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Hey. Come back into my life. Okay. Bye.
Kacey_Laine|@BrandonSkeie I refilled my Starbucks gold card before I paid rent #priorities
Kacey_Laine|NEW video will be up tomorrow!! Be sure you've seen my last video! I'll be DM'ing people who tweet out the link! &lt;3 http://t.co/lmLVcMrfVM
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood hahah the number of times I've just randomly fallen down is embarrassing. Not even tripped, just fallen. Hahahah 😂🙈
Kacey_Laine|I've realized I'm a very clumsy person. I've hit my head on windows, way too many times to admit.
Kacey_Laine|Booking flights stresses me out. Knowing me I would end up at the wrong location on the wrong day. I shouldn't be trusted with these things.
Kacey_Laine|My head feels like there's a small child running around and screaming inside of it. So that's a thing. Happy Friday 😐
Kacey_Laine|Today I witnessed a line form outside of a taco truck that was stopped at a red light. I contemplated getting out of my car to get in line.
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood I'm almost positive I will be there!! And yes we must meet! @VidCon, make it happen 😏
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I'm so sorry lovey. Sending you lots of hugs! Try to make the best out of today!! 😘
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Yes yes! I will be filming it [hopefully] this weekend! But it's on my list for the first half of the month :)
Kacey_Laine|So @amazon's promoted tweet got me. I clicked their link. How did they know I needed a rechargeable battery? #science http://t.co/ThjsbZ8IwZ
Kacey_Laine|• red, white &amp; blue • http://t.co/VjShno8PDq http://t.co/WjfLJzJg3V
Kacey_Laine|Kacey Laine is getting organized today. Meaning lots of list making. Am I the only one who loves making lists?! Yes...okay.
Kacey_Laine|Please pray for my Internet to actually cooperate this morning!!
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 literally just had the same feeling. Then looked outside and saw it was the trash man 😭
Kacey_Laine|I had a dream I was in Vegas. Who wants to go on a roadtrip?
Kacey_Laine|10pm and my brain has officially shut off #19goingon90
Kacey_Laine|Now my question is do I go to sleep &amp; hope I wake up early enough to get my work done? Or try to power through tonight when I can't think?
Kacey_Laine|I can't tell if my eyes are really tired or if my contacts are making me blind. I feel like this isn't a normal struggle. #kaceyproblems
Kacey_Laine|This is the life [hold on tight]. http://t.co/jttNBUGTqQ
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood yes!! I've looked into this!! Hahahah I just hate going to the grocery store 😂
Kacey_Laine|Just saw a picture from my college decision day 2 years ago. Oh wow how things have changed...
Kacey_Laine|@SkylarDayne @AprilLockhart @ShayMooney @dansmyers I'm dying 😍😭
Kacey_Laine|Stopping at Starbucks was a bad idea. Is there a VIP line for gold card members?
Kacey_Laine|I own an iron but I was too lazy to use it so I ironed my shorts with my straightener #resourceful 💁
Kacey_Laine|Why yes, I am considering adding 20 minutes to my drive to work, just so I can stop at a drive thru Starbucks...
Kacey_Laine|I apologize. http://t.co/dZzchfDRkH
Kacey_Laine|I decided to have soup for dinner. It was bad. This is why I have trust issues.
Kacey_Laine|Literally everyone on my Facebook feed is getting in relationships and I still can't decide what to eat for dinner #icantcommit
Kacey_Laine|@jessbrooks18 etsy!
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie I am so sorry, Angie &lt;33 Sending lots of love and prayers your way &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I'm so sorry my love. I know it doesn't make it any better, but if I lived closer I'd eat lunch with you every day :)
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood Hahaha yesss it was the perfect use of the word. I need to start adding it into my vocabulary more often ;)
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Ah man!! Maybe they'll replay it?!
Kacey_Laine|Y'all have been there for me when I need it most, and I want you to know I'm always here for you. Please, never feel alone &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan And sending you lots of love and hugs! Hoping today went okay for you! &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan It's on Netflix!! I'm thinking I may need to watch it tonight :))
Kacey_Laine|And I want to send out a daily appreciation tweet to y'all as well. I truly don't know what I'd do without you. Thank you &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|I need to send out my daily appreciation tweet to @yestarawood. She always knows just what to say and I am so thankful for her! &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@evienoel101 you're too sweet 😘💁
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan yes!! #sofetch 💁😘
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood thank you so much Tara. The fact that you always believe in me even when I don't, really means a lot to me &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood My exact thinking. It was time for a change that was more me and represents who I am :) love you darling &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|• I hear her hair's insured for $10,000 • http://t.co/zRLC0maNIS http://t.co/2GblcvL1IO
Kacey_Laine|@sarah0542 no it wasn't mean at all! I completely agree and I know I can be a very negative person and I'm sorry if it can get annoying.
Kacey_Laine|@sarah0542 I'm sorry if it bothers you and I understand if you wanna unfollow. I tweet how I feel and sometimes it's negative. I'm sorry!
Kacey_Laine|I'm in a very self hating mood right now so just let me be. Sorry if my tweets annoy you...they annoy me too.
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes you just have to give up on taking a picture on a quality camera and resort to the iPhone. The bluriness works in my favor.
Kacey_Laine|When you're too ugly for selfies #me
Kacey_Laine|@beautybaby44 I usually skip through snapchat stories because I don't care. But I watched your entire one. I'm in love 😍✨
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 #thisisthelife #holdontight sorry. I felt that quoting Hannah Montana was appropriate. Because it always is.
Kacey_Laine|Actually considering getting ready, only to take an instagram picture...#isitworthit
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan of course my love :) haha you are always so sweet 😘😘
Kacey_Laine|Same trailer, different park. http://t.co/04XMtHSUsw
Kacey_Laine|@dfordelight Like this is something I really need to do. Because too many times have I been running to the door attempting to put on pants.
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan 3. Like way too many times. Hahahahha
Kacey_Laine|"To the man obnoxiously ringing my doorbell. I already said ""Hold on"", now give me a minute so I can answer the door wearing pants."
Kacey_Laine|Waking up sick results in me laying in bed watching every episode of New Girl.
Kacey_Laine|It's a good day if I don't fall down in public.
Kacey_Laine|I have officially changed my twitter to @Kacey_Laine!! Yay for new/better/much needed/long awaited changes! #ripSBXO
Kacey_Laine|#sodone
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I replied &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I don't mind at all darling. I'm here anytime you need me &lt;3
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan I'm always here for you darling &lt;33 feel free to message me on here anytime!

Kacey_Laine|Hey you. Do you wanna see a new video from me? Like now? Or I guess it's more like in 10 minutes...but still...do yah?
Kacey_Laine|"@CarlyCristman ""Y'all are old people today- leave those Velcro shoes and light jackets on your person."" Sounds legit."
Kacey_Laine|"@CarlyCristman is it the random tsa pre-check? Cuz I don't get that. Are we just ""randomly"" safe? 😐 #ilovetofly"

Kacey_Laine|@PennyChic Intern, booty gahroo, pageant princess, and photographer. Expanding my resume every day ;)
Kacey_Laine|Seeing engagement posts on Facebook make me rethink my life. Then I realize I'm only 19 &amp; it's okay if my only relationship is with Netflix.
Kacey_Laine|@AprilLockhart @SkylarDayne I LOVE THIS. I'M ON TEAM BOTH. AND TEAM KACEY. I WISH I WAS IN NASHVILLE. OKAY BYE.
Kacey_Laine|I forgot to get bagels when I went to the store so I had to have cream cheese on a slice of bread. It actually wasn't too bad.
Kacey_Laine|I just need to find a funny and cute guy who will tell me I'm pretty, play with my hair, and surprise me with Starbucks.
Kacey_Laine|And like why bother with mac&amp;cheese ads? Don't people know how truly wonderful it is? Like they know to buy it #duh
Kacey_Laine|"I keep on seeing ads for mac and cheese. I'm not even hungry. What are they trying to do to me? 
Also, where's the easy mac?"
Kacey_Laine|All white bedding was a really good idea until self tanning season. Now I am sleeping on top of blankets on top of my bed.
Kacey_Laine|@_cceelliinnaaa yesss 😍😏
Kacey_Laine|Life's really hard. Like sometimes the glare from the sun is really bad and gets in the way of my Netflix watching.
Kacey_Laine|@beautybaby44 Can I send you my video to upload?
Kacey_Laine|Been editing all day. But for a video that will be up next Sunday :P So sorry I've been MIA. Don't hate me!
Kacey_Laine|Less than 100 subscribers until the beautiful @AllieMarieEvans hits 200k subscribers! Go send her some love!! http://t.co/IiEtuT63Zz &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu Just wanted to make sure.
Kacey_Laine|"My sister texts me a picture of some lady in a store. I respond, ""you at charming charlies?"" She was impressed at my store spotting skills."
Kacey_Laine|~~**f0ll0w me**~~ #selfpromo #mysisterlovesme #ipromise #maybenot #thatsokayihatemetoo http://t.co/9RCbpVjoa5
Kacey_Laine|My Instagram contains Diet Coke, Starbucks, and selfies. My true loves in life #dontworryihatemetoo
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu are you eating falafel flavored snacks?...
Kacey_Laine|• my [not so] secret love affair • http://t.co/nzqJYClQJd
Kacey_Laine|I just got really excited for my cruise to Alaska this summer because I want to take an epic Titanic picture for Instagram. It'll be great.
Kacey_Laine|@CallieJoyJB Ah that'd be amazing! I'm not sure where our cruise stops or whatnot but would love to make this happen! :D
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy NOOOOO but I loveeeee it
Kacey_Laine|Laying in bed, and I can't stop thinking about you [subtweet: Panera Bread].
Kacey_Laine|I need to find more friends in LA. Because my closest friend here is the FedEx guy. &amp;&amp; he doesn't seem to really care about our friendship 😐
Kacey_Laine|I feel like Snow White. Minus the animals and little men. So I'm just a girl with a red lip. http://t.co/aYt1u7pd36
Kacey_Laine|So due to my computer being stupid and deleting all my footage, new video will have to be up tomorrow. I'm sorry :(((
Kacey_Laine|If you were to show up at my front door with Starbucks, I wouldn't turn you away.
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 ...&amp; you have to keep going &amp; prove that. You are beautiful inside and out and you make my life brighter every day. Thank you &lt;3
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 ...giving up is the only thing that seems like it would work, but it's not. You have so much to live for and so much potential..
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 I promise you that if you keep fighting, it will be worth it. I know it doesn't seem like it now, and there are many days when..
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 Sending big hugs beautiful! Always remember that you are so loved and truly a wonderful young lady. Keep smiling pretty girl &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@joudisBeliever hahahah planning out videos and literally just scribbling out my thoughts. Hahahah
Kacey_Laine|Like I'm actually stalking the #Stagecoach2014 Instagram and crying 😭
Kacey_Laine|I'm not at Stagecoach this weekend and I want to cry 😭😭 Someone please sneak me in, I can fit in your cowboy hat.
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes I have extremely legible handwriting 😐 [yes this is English] http://t.co/bcQ9VV7lLN
Kacey_Laine|Good morning sunshine! Getting ready to film a very special video that'll go up in a couple weeks ❤️ [also going to try to upload today!]
Kacey_Laine|10:30 on a Friday night...that's bedtime, right? 😴👵 #19goingon90
Kacey_Laine|@lovenector13 I think I'm working next weekend 😭
Kacey_Laine|Friday night. Baking funfetti cupcakes and binge watching The Mindy Project with friends. Oh wait, no. No friends. I'm alone #partyanimal 🎉🐷
Kacey_Laine|When Hulu asks me to choose one of three ads 😐 No. I don't want an ad. I choose none.
Kacey_Laine|@MarissaLace I thought she was laying on a rice cake. I was impressed.
Kacey_Laine|Starting my 7 day juice cleanse. http://t.co/p1xgMPggnE
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter Like wut. Their social media team is on top of their hate. Not even a subtweet stops them from following.
Kacey_Laine|I see you 😐 http://t.co/K6u3ww9wol
Kacey_Laine|Why does my internet never want to work? Like whenever I need it to work...it decides to not [subtweet: I hate you, Time Warner Cable].
Kacey_Laine|I need to go grocery shopping because I have absolutely no food. But the only thing I can think to put on my list is funfetti cupcakes...
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu @MsMeghanMakeup HAHAHA why are you so funny? Like seriously.
Kacey_Laine|Also, I voluntarily listened to #selfie while driving today. So that's a thing 😐 #itsbeenalongday
Kacey_Laine|There's a random cat in the lobby of my apartment. Oh and did I mention it's wearing a leash and a sweater? 😐 #wut
Kacey_Laine|• you are never too old for fairytales • http://t.co/WoyEmheuP0
Kacey_Laine|@briannadeg no 😭
Kacey_Laine|But, be proud of me. Every time I answered the door, I did have some form of pants and a shirt on #progress #sorryihateclothes
Kacey_Laine|Trying to get ready for work, while men are coming in and out of my apartment fixing drywall, is quite the task.
Kacey_Laine|The ability for me to compose a proper/semi profesh email after 2am is similar to my basketball skills. Ballerrr 💁🏀 But major missed points.
Kacey_Laine|I got home an hour ago expecting to go straight to sleep. I'm still awake. I'm really bad at this whole sleep thing.
Kacey_Laine|@jobrofan1 I'm making up a name next time.
Kacey_Laine|Will they ever spell my name correctly? Probably not. But it was close #goodtry http://t.co/bovpYyym4q
Kacey_Laine|Trying to go to Starbucks, getting there and finding out it's in a Ralph's...and it closed at 9:30 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|I got ready and took a selfie. I didn't like it enough to leave it no filter, but I wanted a selfie #thestruggles http://t.co/WDnUwqgJTx
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan you always matter my dear &lt;3 know that you are worthy of the world. Love you Paydan &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 Ahh yes please!
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan Love you so much darling! You are so beautiful and such a joy to know &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|I do this thing where I will I do my hair, and then throw it up in a messy bun- completely ruining the hour I just spent doing my hair.
Kacey_Laine|I decided to walk to Chipotle. I just got here and I don't wanna walk back. Can I call an Uber?
Kacey_Laine|Now is when I make a [not so] difficult decision. Do I go to Chipotle and eat deliciousness? [yes] Or eat the apple I have at home. [no]
Kacey_Laine|@jcameronp Great meeting you too!! :)
Kacey_Laine|@sarahbelle93 @kristeevetter I already have an order put in for refrigerator magnets and buttons.
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter For my 20th birthday (July 29th hint hint), I want a instacollage. But not of me. Just of you. And all of your gloriousness.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu literally my life, xx, kacey, aka I'm either eating or asleep
Kacey_Laine|Does Starbucks deliver yet?
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu that's funny- sincerely, kacey, aka the coolest person ever
Kacey_Laine|@kristeevetter I SWEAR THIS IS MY FAVORITE PICTURE EVER. Actually it's a tie between this and the beanie baby headband (that was you right?)
Kacey_Laine|"""I want food. I feel like death. My voice is a borderline man voice. But I want pizza. Or Chipotle. Or both"" - a monologue by me pre-sleep 😴"
Kacey_Laine|But actually though. I'm laying in bed and all I can think about is Chipotle and Starbucks. My love affair is real.
Kacey_Laine|Some people fall asleep thinking of their loved ones. I do too, it's just that my loved ones are food.
Kacey_Laine|I just got home &amp; I really want Chipotle but I also really want sleep. So now I'm gunna sleep but you [Chipotle] will forever be on my mind.
Kacey_Laine|"""I'm almost in between the lines"" - me every time I park 😐"
Kacey_Laine|Also, can I just say- I get a lot of weird looks when I'm in Starbucks mixing a refresher into my tea...sorry I like to be my own barista.
Kacey_Laine|[nothing will stop me from tweeting a picture of my Starbucks] http://t.co/otEgSX8hbz
Kacey_Laine|I'm trying to tweet a picture of my Starbucks and the internet is not wanting to work. Is that the world's way of telling me to just not?
Kacey_Laine|Let's just say, today was so close to being a decent day. And then I walked into a wall 😐
Kacey_Laine|Any day that goes by where I don't fall down like an old person, or walk into a wall like an idiot, is a good day.
Kacey_Laine|That moment when I'm sleepy but also loopy. So now I make the decision to go to sleep. Or stay up watching Aziz Ansari on Netflix.
Kacey_Laine|All is well in the world because unlimited Olive Garden breadsticks are a thing.
Kacey_Laine|The fact that I won't be at Stagecoach this weekend makes me sad. I'm missing out on really good country music, &amp; even better Instagrams 😭😭
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu sad thing- it's happened more than once.
Kacey_Laine|A little kid in the elevator was showing me the microscope that the Easter bunny got him yesterday. He's my new best friend.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu does it count if I put one on and then lay down next to it? If so, I've done that 😐
Kacey_Laine|Really not into the whole people thing today. Like can you just not. Why can't I live among burritos?
Kacey_Laine|@KalelKitten YES. 15 years of gymnastics def screwed up my body 😁
Kacey_Laine|@CaliMakeup14 I use picmonkey! :)
Kacey_Laine|Editing a video for y'all! Make sure you've seen my most recent video! [ft. flawless foundation and super hawt hair] https://t.co/vzoNFIG4fM
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu Okay the ziplock bag should be good for that too. You may need a gallon bag though- the sandwich ones may be a tight squeeze.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu perf. And just put it in a sandwich baggie and FedEx it over. Ziplock'll keep it fresh.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu send me one
Kacey_Laine|Woke up still feeling like death 😭😷 Why am I always sick??
Kacey_Laine|@lovenector13 @kristeevetter pretty sure they weren't there. But I heard The Cheetah Girls made an epic appearance.
Kacey_Laine|@KassyOrozco sorry if you don't care for my sense of humor! :)
Kacey_Laine|Correction. I can't tell if it's a mini mullet or two rat tails. Will keep you updated.
Kacey_Laine|Man with the mini mullet: please stop talking to me on the shuttle. I'm not here to make friends 😐
Kacey_Laine|I get high. http://t.co/bla37EcDTV
Kacey_Laine|Help. I keep sneezing and sniffling and feeling like death and people keep staring at me. Like I know I need to stop, but I can't 😭😷😐
Kacey_Laine|Why are there birds in the airport? Like they aren't supposed to be here. We are inside.
Kacey_Laine|I swear I live at the airport. It's fun 😐
Kacey_Laine|Stuffing my face with too much food then getting on an airplane. Happy Easter y'all.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I luh youuuuu
Kacey_Laine|LA. I'll be back tomorrow. Be ready for me.
Kacey_Laine|@ryancharchian Ahhh you're a lifesaverrrr
Kacey_Laine|@MissLovelyLayla No :(((
Kacey_Laine|Help. I just finished season 2 of Scandal on Netflix and I can't find season 3 anywhere online. This is a real life issue people.
Kacey_Laine|"Adding #sorrynotsorry before saying ""you look awful"" makes it so super sweet 😘😐"
Kacey_Laine|I really want froyo. Like really bad. But I'm trapped at home. Oh the struggles.
Kacey_Laine|@JennJoy_YT right?!?
Kacey_Laine|Ohmygosh. Stop it. This kid is precious 😍 http://t.co/8Fogg9Nfz4
Kacey_Laine|My grandpa would be a great YouTube commenter. He's really good at asking lots of questions &amp; giving backhanded compliments. But I love him.
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy I go half sandwich, soup, and baguette. Always. And it's flawless #teampanera 😍
Kacey_Laine|Between the 3 inch burn scar on my thigh and giant bruise on my knee, I won't be wearing shorts anytime soon 😐 #sorryimclumsy
Kacey_Laine|Can I go back to sleep? 😴☕️
Kacey_Laine|Out of all the people in the world, I dislike you the least.
Kacey_Laine|I bake cookies and then I don't want to eat them. But then when I want cookies, I have none. It's a real struggle.
Kacey_Laine|I ran out of Diet Coke. I think we all know how my day is going.
Kacey_Laine|@TheJessAgee Awhhh I love you!!! And your voice is absolutely flawless!!! &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|• sweatshirt and messy bun • http://t.co/rzFWBCNrds http://t.co/VV1OsqWqut
Kacey_Laine|"SURPRISE! New video is LIVE! Foundation Routine | Spring 2014 ♥ http://t.co/sJbknM7Dgy"
Kacey_Laine|There may be a very special surprise on my channel very soon *hint, hint* http://t.co/PwL5cK43P7
Kacey_Laine|I was having a bad day. Then I got a Diet Coke. I'm still having a bad day, but at least I have Diet Coke.
Kacey_Laine|@BalletBree17 Sending you so much love and prayers my darling &lt;33 If you ever need anything, I'm only a tweet away. Love you &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@MarissaLace may 18, 2012
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 send my love to my favorite family!!! 😘❤️
Kacey_Laine|sleep
Kacey_Laine|@MakeupbyMandy24 literally me.
Kacey_Laine|Remember that time I was an old person and fell in the middle of the airport? Yeah, I got a bruise on my knee 😐 #helpivefallenandicantgetup
Kacey_Laine|take me back to the concrete jungle http://t.co/UYcE9s67mh
Kacey_Laine|They say it'll get better.
Kacey_Laine|@KaceyLaine Hi! I was wondering if you are actively using this account? If not, would it be possible for me to use this username? Thank you!
Kacey_Laine|My favorite part of coming home is getting all sorts of mail 😍 and eating lots of free food 😍😍 and I guess seeing my family 😐
Kacey_Laine|I think I may be an old person. Was just walking and fell down. Didn't trip, just fell. And like fully down 😂😐
Kacey_Laine|@meghanrosette Buttonwillow is my favorite place in the world.
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood home!! :)
Kacey_Laine|There are so many old people at the airport today. Like so many. I think there may be a convention #theonlyexplanation
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip it was cahyuteeee. And the lady was carrying a Coach purse. So she gets your high/low idea 😏😘
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip I saw an orange zebra Jansport at the airport today. I think I found your next bag. Currently looking for online coupons.
Kacey_Laine|Wishing a very happy birthday to the beautiful, @pennychic! I am so lucky to call you my boss, role… http://t.co/zMOpIvoU3p
Kacey_Laine|@hellokatyxo and it didn't matter if I was gunna be late to class- I needed to get my Starbucks 😏🙈 hahaha
Kacey_Laine|@hellokatyxo I loved it. It was an expensive habit but it helped relax me before school :) hahah
Kacey_Laine|Fun fact: I went to Starbucks every morning before school my senior year in high school. And that was at 5:45am. It's my true love.
Kacey_Laine|Decided to go to the Starbucks drive thru before heading to the airport. This may have been a bad idea. Oh well. I love Starbucks.
Kacey_Laine|Sad tears won't last for forever. Simply because I won't let them.
Kacey_Laine|FAVORITE PERSON OF THE DAY: @yestarawood. Currently crying happy tears because I am so blessed to know such a perfect young lady &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@brittanyybeach Thank you Brittany &lt;3 You have always been such a big support and friend to me, so thank you &lt;3
Kacey_Laine|They say it gets better with time. That time heals everything. That &amp; good friends. But we're 2 months shy of 3 years &amp; I'm still sad&amp;alone.
Kacey_Laine|@xoalexisrose Thank you Alexis, it's nice to know I'm not alone. Know I'm always here for you &lt;33 We can help each other!
Kacey_Laine|It's weird. Seeing life go on. Even after you swore it wouldn't. People move on, people ignore, people find better. And then, there you are.
Kacey_Laine|I just wanna talk. I miss having good conversations with people who are genuinely interested in me and my life.
Kacey_Laine|@_JennTaylor Yeah I was taught young, so I can kinda remember the basics but then anything past that, I'm clueless :P
Kacey_Laine|"I was searching an online store, ""the best craft store in LA"", when I realized I didn't know what to buy. Back to Pinterest for ideas."
Kacey_Laine|@_JennTaylor I've had a sewing machine since I was 12! Never really learned how to properly use it, but I can kinda do it :)
Kacey_Laine|I have migrated from Pinterest and Etsy to now searching on Yelp for the best craft store in Los Angeles. I'm horrible at crafts...
Kacey_Laine|I'm currently looking up DIY &amp; decor ideas on Pinterest. Meanwhile, I have to be at the airport at 9 tomorrow. Kacey, no crafting tonight.
Kacey_Laine|@laurenmallare I read it! Sending so much love to you and I am so proud of you &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|Good people make me happy.
Kacey_Laine|"Surprising but the flourless cupcake that's kosher for Passover from @sprinkles, is really good. Like not just ""kosher good"", actual good."
Kacey_Laine|@lexielombard LOVE. Like actually my favorite.
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood YOU ARE FLAWLESS MISS TARA!  Like actually though, you are so amazing and I'm so lucky to know you &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood Ah thank you darling! :)
Kacey_Laine|@beautybaby44 Uhmmm whaaa? I was literally there 2 hours ago. JBiebz should have gotten a cupcake with me.
Kacey_Laine|Why do I always draw a blank when it comes to finding good new music for a video?! @yestarawood, I need your help!!
Kacey_Laine|Was just informed that my flight tomorrow has free wifi 😍 Now I won't have to suffer through the hour long flight home.
Kacey_Laine|Why yes I did wear running gear to get a Passover kosher cupcake. And yes, I know, I'm like superrrr tan. http://t.co/nmvlCpl7y6
Kacey_Laine|• mega inspiring quote that has everything [nothing] to do with my selfie • http://t.co/AYzQscs0FX
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 :( I'm sorry love. Just keep trying. I know you'll be able to do it &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu I would cry tears of joy from either 😂😂
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu I would cry tears of joy 😭❤️
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu edible arrangements are the perfect gift for any day.
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 Good luck darling!! You can do it! :)
Kacey_Laine|@OhHale2theNo yes! :)
Kacey_Laine|I really want [need] a cupcake. But it's Passover. So I'm stuck with looking at cupcakes on Pinterest 🎂😭
Kacey_Laine|My competitive side comes out when I'm checking in for a flight. And I always win.
Kacey_Laine|@SimplyRobynJoy right?! It makes me wish I could cook/bake!! Hahah
Kacey_Laine|I really want to lay in bed and watch MasterChef all day. But I have to clean and unpack...and then repack.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo yes please. Like I need you back in my life asap.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Remember that time your car broke &amp; we saw a cat in a Christmas suit? Yeah...I miss you like way a lot. http://t.co/iyWlfI3oXs
Kacey_Laine|#transformationtuesdayminusthetransformation I was/am weird. But look at the on point tie up top and pigtails #90s http://t.co/9QUolKcFss
Kacey_Laine|Can I pretend I'm still on east coast time and go to sleep now? 😴
Kacey_Laine|Currently curled up on my couch feeling like death. Why do I always get sick after traveling? Literally I just want to go to sleep 😷😭😴
Kacey_Laine|Trying to edit a video for this week and really not liking anything I filmed 😭 Send positivity my way because negative nancy can't edit.
Kacey_Laine|@hellokatyxo You are so gorgeous. Like just stop it 😍
Kacey_Laine|I'm completely okay with this 😍 #TransformationTuesday http://t.co/5k7Iv3f3tt
Kacey_Laine|@PoppyCampen thank you!! 😘
Kacey_Laine|Sending a very happy birthday to the beautiful, hard working, and truly inspirational @severshed! 😘🎉✨
Kacey_Laine|@aspynovard Happy birthday my beautiful girl!! Hope you have a fabulous day! And I can't wait for you to be in LA so soon!! 😍🎉✨
Kacey_Laine|Literally so tired 😴 I just want to sleep. But I have to get things done. But my bed is so snuggly.
Kacey_Laine|It's 3am. I better be asleep like now.
Kacey_Laine|I think I might be able to say LAX isn't absolutely horrible. But also it's 1am and nobody is here.
Kacey_Laine|After this mess of a flight, I'm expecting a surprise party waiting for me when I get off this plane. But LA, I have arrived.
Kacey_Laine|Apparently people are watching the moon tonight. Try and see if you can find me in the plane.
Kacey_Laine|I'm so over this flight. I just want to be home in my bed 😭😴
Kacey_Laine|@jenna_nicole101 I have my headphones in loud enough so I can't hear any of them 🙉🙈
Kacey_Laine|The turbulence on this flight 😐🔫
Kacey_Laine|I'm next to two toddlers and there's a baby behind me 😐 This will be a fun 6.5 hour flight.
Kacey_Laine|Traveling back in time to the flight to NYC. Now I'm stuck at the airport waiting to go home ✈️ http://t.co/xTPIa0PNnB
Kacey_Laine|Stop it. The dance kid just whipped out a light saber from his suitcase. I can't tell if I hate these kids or if I wanna be friends.
Kacey_Laine|I am now watching one kid perform a dance routine while another practices his tennis swing (with the racket of course) 😐 Get me out of here.
Kacey_Laine|I am now sprawled across 2 chairs (and have my stuff on a third). I am making JFK airport my home.
Kacey_Laine|I just want to get on the plane and sleep. Like now. I apologize to whoever sits next to me, I may use your shoulder as a pillow.
Kacey_Laine|@CarlyCristman gahhh I know! As soon as I get home I'm buying one. Hahaha
Kacey_Laine|Do I give up my seat next to an outlet to buy an overpriced airport Diet Coke? Or suck it up &amp; deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache? 😩
Kacey_Laine|I just realized I'm stuck at the airport for another 2 hours. And then stuck on the plane for 6.5 more hours 😭😭😭 I just wanna be homeeee.
Kacey_Laine|@emcr8ton Thank youuu :)
Kacey_Laine|@MokisHome you suck
Kacey_Laine|I'm stuck in the airport. Someone save me. http://t.co/NFfupd3yem
Kacey_Laine|I've been at the airport for 2 hours. I'm stuck here for another 3 hours 😭
Kacey_Laine|"Some man at the airport just said to me, ""I bet you were a perfect baby"" 😁😐 #strangerdanger"
Kacey_Laine|My driver is crazy. He keeps making a rock on sign and waving his arm around. Like...wut 😐
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu seriously like get off of me.
Kacey_Laine|Apparently personal space doesn't exist in elevators. If we are the only 2 people on the elevator, you don't need to stand on top of me 😐
Kacey_Laine|@MsGellykaMarie since HSM 😍
Kacey_Laine|@catrific Mine does that too! You have to refresh the page and then it stops :P
Kacey_Laine|UHMMM. YES PLEASE 😍 #ManCrushMonday http://t.co/fcIxJ4ArRt
Kacey_Laine|It's too early to be awake. http://t.co/L0Nuh7GvdH
Kacey_Laine|To my cab driver: please don't drive through Times Square. There are ways around it. You're just taking the long way (aka more $$) 😐 #no
Kacey_Laine|@Lonestar_Prep forever21!
Kacey_Laine|Had such a fun time at @benefitbeauty tonight!! Lots of yummy sweets, gorgeous people, and on point… http://t.co/audBAsKXlM
Kacey_Laine|@Chloedelgg can't wait to meet you!! 😘
Kacey_Laine|And LIVE from New York, it's...Sunday afternoon? http://t.co/tByFdmCwfz
Kacey_Laine|@DaniAustin2 @AllieMarieEvans I was in my booties so obvies I'm tall.
Kacey_Laine|Taking selfies in the elevator, then 7 people crowded in. Kinda killed my selfie game.
Kacey_Laine|For those asking, I will not be at IMATS today 😥 Spending the day exploring the city with my family!
Kacey_Laine|• a day of exploring • @ NYC. http://t.co/ydnvOOJmH4
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu snaps are more secretive 😏
Kacey_Laine|I think I'm in cash cab. http://t.co/KukQqBiLaW
Kacey_Laine|The thought of getting out of bed this morning made me sad, so I did my makeup while laying in bed.
Kacey_Laine|After a very long day in NYC, I'm in my happy place (aka snuggled up in blankets about to sleep).
Kacey_Laine|Awkward conversations with my cab driver. Oh how I love exploring NYC by myself.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo @jizcalifuh so how's the screen door?
Kacey_Laine|I've gotten pretty good at navigating New York by myself. I've taken the subway and gotten 2 cabs all on my own #amiarealadultyet
Kacey_Laine|Hello IMATS!!
Kacey_Laine|Side note. My dad accidentally left his wallet in my purse...shopping spree? 😏 #thanksdad
Kacey_Laine|In the cab on my way to IMATS!! Who will I be seeing there?! 😘🎉
Kacey_Laine|I was just thinking...sleep is really weird. Like we just decide to lay down and die for a few hours. Like wut 😐😴 #obviesimtired
Kacey_Laine|@AvrieFowler I don't think so :((
Kacey_Laine|After walking around the city all day I've decided to rethink my outfit choice for tomorrow (aka not wear the shoes I was going to).
Kacey_Laine|@MissStephMarie_ @missglamorazzi @MakeupbyMandy24 Yay!! Can't wait! :)
Kacey_Laine|Yes please 😍 http://t.co/PMWcdR4fIj
Kacey_Laine|• city life • http://t.co/LE1SJ8hDcJ
Kacey_Laine|I'm so sleepyyyy. Goodnight New York 🌃💤
Kacey_Laine|@meghanrosette okay you look absolutely precious 😍
Kacey_Laine|Surprise reunions at the airport make me really happy.
Kacey_Laine|@TheDeeSebial oh haaaiiiiiii
Kacey_Laine|New York. I have officially arrived. Except that I'm posted at the airport for 2 hours waiting for my family to get in. But I'm here.
Kacey_Laine|@SamanthaConnery be sure to comment on my Instagram picture! @BenefitBeauty is holding a meetup on Sunday but there's limited space :)
Kacey_Laine|• LA to NYC essentials • http://t.co/5ZAWy0kW1G
Kacey_Laine|Tweeting from the sky ✈️
Kacey_Laine|I fell back asleep after waking up. It took twice as long to drive because of the fog. And then I parked in the wrong parking lot. Good day.
Kacey_Laine|Why am I awake right now? Oh yeah, I decided now would be a good time to go to the airport...
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu kisses 😘💁
Kacey_Laine|I have to be up in 5 hours. That doesn't sound too bad until I realize that I have to be awake at 2am. Legit, why did I do this to myself?
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu sucks2suck
Kacey_Laine|@ayydubs YEAH GURRRRLLLL. Tomorrow!!
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 One day we shall meet! :D
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu Good because you weren't invited
Kacey_Laine|• Taking my brow game to NYC • Want to meet me at @BenefitBeauty in New York this Sunday? 😘❤️✨ http://t.co/kFwN36DI5i
Kacey_Laine|I HAVE A WORKING PHONE! All is well in the world.
Kacey_Laine|Current question of the hour- why don't I have a landline phone? I have no way of communicating with people other than by Twitter and email.
Kacey_Laine|Update: currently trying to update it with iTunes on my computer- it's closed from the app but now frozen on the update screen :((
Kacey_Laine|@RebeccaKSampson That's what I'm trying now :P Hopefully it'll figure itself out!
Kacey_Laine|I'm about 2 minutes away from throwing my phone at the wall. Like it needs to fix itself asap.
Kacey_Laine|@MarissaLace on my computer lolz
Kacey_Laine|So my phone's freaking out. It's stuck on an app and won't do anything and my lock button doesn't work so I can't shut it down. Help meeeee.
Kacey_Laine|@hollysaysheyy Airport and then New York!!!!!! :D
Kacey_Laine|I'm so looking forward to tomorrow morning...not 😐 http://t.co/egyHzHXv66
Kacey_Laine|@EmSFrederick Yeah I'll be there through Monday :))
Kacey_Laine|@just2dancee Awh I'm sorry! If you will be in the NYC area this weekend, be sure to check my Instagram later today :)
Kacey_Laine|@just2dancee I haven't been to BeautyCon before and I don't think I am going to BeautyCon NYC this year :/
Kacey_Laine|I will be the first one to admit that my content over the last few months hasn't been my best. But I'm ready to step it up and do werk ;)
Kacey_Laine|ALSO!! Once I'm back from NYC, I'm getting my booty back into producing good &amp; consistent content for y'all! So send me video requests!!
Kacey_Laine|@itsbl0ndie Literally me. My entire closet was on my floor for about 4 days. Hahah [ps. Can't wait to meet you!!! :D]
Kacey_Laine|Today is devoted to cleaning/organizing, filming, and prepping for New York. Early morning tomorrow and a busy weekend ahead of me :))
Kacey_Laine|I've realized I'm really good at being an adult. Like I know how to use the microwave to make easy mac and cheese 💁 #wifemeup
Kacey_Laine|Why did I decide to paint my nails before I've washed dishes and made dinner? Now I'm starving and I have to wait for my nails to dry 😭
Kacey_Laine|Looking for spring outfit inspiration? Check out the lookbook I produced and edited for @PennyChic!! &lt;33 https://t.co/kK2s8x54bh
Kacey_Laine|@therealmk_ You're too sweet &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|Today it was 93 degrees. I think it's time to break out the self tanner before I blind all of Los Angeles with my ghost-like complexion 👻☀️
Kacey_Laine|@macaa09 Ah muchas gracias!
Kacey_Laine|@macaa09 Si! Un poco :)
Kacey_Laine|Taking four years of Spanish is paying off. Just had to fill out a form that was entirely in Spanish. And I didn't even use GoogleTranslate.
Kacey_Laine|I'm like really good at putting on workout clothes and looking like I'm going to workout, when in reality I am just too lazy to get dressed.
Kacey_Laine|@therealmk_ Why yes of course :)
Kacey_Laine|• good morning • http://t.co/mVlKBSa22t
Kacey_Laine|Internet beware. My dad said he was going to be instagramming our trip to New York. [Side note: he barely knows how to use his iPhone]
Kacey_Laine|Question. Is there anyway to stretch patent leather heels? Or am I stuck with super uncomfortable shoes?
Kacey_Laine|Been listening to @DanAndShay all day today. Absolutely in love with their new album &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|@TFGMorgan can I come visit you?? I miss you pretty girl! When do I get to see you next?!
Kacey_Laine|Attention world: my internet fixed itself. Everyone may continue about their lives normally.
Kacey_Laine|@axtripolitis oooh okay! I'm updating all the software on it to see if maybe it just wasn't up to date so we'll have to see!
Kacey_Laine|@axtripolitis how do I figure out if that's it?
Kacey_Laine|So my Internet on my computer decided to stop working. Like it shows the wifi is good but won't load any websites. Someone help meeee.
Kacey_Laine|@glamourista16 nooooo 😭😭😭 I miss youuuuu. But on the bright side I get to see you everyday this summer!!!!!!!!!! 😍☀️😭🎉💃
Kacey_Laine|In less than 30 minutes I managed to write my acceptance speech, get my hair caught in a jacket, and then become miserably sick #fun
Kacey_Laine|@Daniandkaceyfan awh I love you Paydan &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|Apparently I'm sick. Randomly got light headed and then threw up. I hate this. Someone come take care of me and make me feel better please.
Kacey_Laine|I'd like to thank my friends &amp; family. Thanks to TSwift's always on point dancing. I'd also like to thank Luke Bryan's booty. And America 🇺🇸
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo 😐
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo I hate you.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo did you die? 😘😍😏
Kacey_Laine|For those of you not aware of the flawlessness that is Luke Bryan. I present to you my favorite video on YouTube... https://t.co/jeJXwdiW9A
Kacey_Laine|But like actually though, where do I find my own Luke Bryan? 😍
Kacey_Laine|@glamourista16 WHAAA??? Are you going to be there for IMATS?!?
Kacey_Laine|@_cceelliinnaaa he's always flawless.
Kacey_Laine|Luke Bryan. That is all.
Kacey_Laine|Someone please tell me why I wasn't in Vegas for the ACMs.
Kacey_Laine|I've made progress. All of my clothes are hung up/folded/in the laundry. Now who wants to organize my closet? And style outfits for me :)
Kacey_Laine|Someone please come clean and organize my closet for me. Currently all of my clothes are on the floor. It's a struggle.
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 Absolutely!!
Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 I had my sunglasses on and I showed absolutely zero emotion. Hahaha
Kacey_Laine|I see that you're all in love and junk- but please, when in an elevator, don't make out and then giggle that you forgot to press a button.
Kacey_Laine|In the past 4 days I've been asked if I work at Sears twice, and Forever 21 once. I don't know what the world is trying to tell me.
Kacey_Laine|Trying to decide on outfits when you're in a bad mood and hating everything in life is never a good idea.
Kacey_Laine|@severshed @LANow is this why literally everyone in LA is on a bike or scooter?!
Kacey_Laine|@lizziekuss that's always my go to. Hahaha
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood white low top converse. And they were both guys. Hahah
Kacey_Laine|Pretty much I don't like being around real human beings. I'm just awkward.
Kacey_Laine|Elevators make me uncomfortable. Especially when you're w/ two strangers &amp; you all happen to be wearing the same shoes &amp; they point it out 😐
Kacey_Laine|I feel like such a grown up. Just reserved my airport parking (and I found the best deal that's not in a sketchy area). I'm proud of me.
Kacey_Laine|@emmarainson Possibly!! I'm not positive yet, but I may :)
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu My thought every day. Then I figure that being able to see out my window is enough interaction I need with the outside world.
Kacey_Laine|In 5 days, I will be in New York. Y'all don't know how excited I am. Except now I have to plan outfits- please, can I wear footie pajamas??
Kacey_Laine|Do I get up and start the day (aka be productive)? Or do I stay snuggled up in my comfy bed? #decisionsdecisions
Kacey_Laine|Waking up and having no clue where you are. Then remembering you moved 6 months ago and you are in fact, in your own apartment 😐
Kacey_Laine|Getting snapchats of my friends fun Saturday nights. And what am I doing? Working. Then watching Shark Tank #iwin
Kacey_Laine|@marinellamenez I'm almost positive I got it at either Urban Outfitters! Or Anthropology. But I think it was Urban :)
Kacey_Laine|"Editing Kacey does not like filming Kacey. Literally anytime I edit my constant thoughts are ""Why are you stupid? Film better, please."""
Kacey_Laine|"Spending the day editing the lookbook I ""produced"" for the amazing @PennyChic! Absolutely loving how it's turning out, stay tuned :)"
Kacey_Laine|Had to update my wardrobe for spring. Loving this dress from @WetSeal 😍❤️✨ #CrushCru http://t.co/rHWQ6Lwi30
Kacey_Laine|When I'm falling asleep practically on my computer, I'd say that it's probably time to shut down Final Cut Pro and go to sleep.
Kacey_Laine|Why do I decide it's a good idea to start on more work at 10 at night? Literally, nothing I do ever makes sense.
Kacey_Laine|I don't care that I have no friends. There's enough excitement and drama on Shark Tank. And I don't have to wear pants.
Kacey_Laine|I want to go on Shark Tank. I have no ideas. I just want to go and ask for money to go shopping. In exchange for 20% of my Instagram likes.
Kacey_Laine|Spending my Friday night on the couch watching Shark Tank. I'd say I'm quite the party animal [get it...because a shark is an animal 😏😐]
Kacey_Laine|@kimberleyxlynn I'm spending my Friday night catching up on Shark Tank. I have no regrets. 😍🐋 (pretend that's a shark. Hahah)
Kacey_Laine|AHHHHH!!!! Congratulations to my best friend, @DaniAustin2, on 100k subscribers!! Now get your booty to LA so we can celebrate!!!
Kacey_Laine|"Updating my all black wardrobe to be more ""spring like"". Must have all the florals from @WetSeal 💐💗 http://t.co/1s2Cz8qGmF #CrushCru"
Kacey_Laine|Front row seat to @missglamorazzi's panel at #LuckyFABB 💗 [oh hey @lisaflip] http://t.co/RAowp6Ijrl
Kacey_Laine|I feel so professional 💁 #LuckyFABB http://t.co/D7jZqA7nXx
Kacey_Laine|My spring essentials. Starbucks and florals from @WetSeal 💗💐✨ #CrushCru http://t.co/qxaHkDAG6e
Kacey_Laine|Casual photo shoot in the @WetSeal dressing room 💁✨ #CrushCru http://t.co/DHlSp7rtv7
Kacey_Laine|Necessary break from working to do some shopping. Loving what @WetSeal has in stores &lt;3 http://t.co/1s2Cz8qGmF #CrushCru
Kacey_Laine|HEY YOU. My best friend, @DaniAustin2, is less than 200 away from 100,000 subscribers!! Go make it happen!! https://t.co/oLiSqidwGi
Kacey_Laine|@CBQx Hahahaha yesssss this is literally me. Except for when I'm forced to leave the house- and then none of my clothes are good enough.
Kacey_Laine|I love how I try to plan an outfit that somewhat fits the season. And then decide on all black...I need to go shopping.
Kacey_Laine|I've gone through my entire closet and come to the conclusion that I have no clothes. Or I guess, nothing that's good.
Kacey_Laine|"Planning outfits for events is my least favorite thing. Why is it considered ""unprofessional"" if I wear my bunny footie pajamas?"
Kacey_Laine|It's late. And I haven't eaten since this morning. But I finally finished redesigning my YouTube banner. Go look. https://t.co/w0l1rXSJh1
Kacey_Laine|@TaylorNoelle Ah so exciting!!!
Kacey_Laine|@87daysbefore @ayydubs YAYAYAYYY
Kacey_Laine|@TaylorNoelle AH YAYYY!!
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu @ayydubs Literally it will just be you Alyx. You walking around an empty warehouse. Enjoy.
Kacey_Laine|@ayydubs I AMMMM.
Kacey_Laine|@thenameislela Hahahah it's allowed anywhere I think ;)
Kacey_Laine|@yestarawood I thought this said a nice kitten...I was slightly confused. Hahah
Kacey_Laine|Yes I am wearing a sweatshirt and yoga pants in public today. No judgements please, I know I look fabulous.
Kacey_Laine|Sometimes all you need is a little escape. http://t.co/yP0zD3i6Tu
Kacey_Laine|I don't like how I can see emojis on my computer now. It makes me uncomfortable. Bring back the blank boxes.
Kacey_Laine|I woke up with a giant red stripe on my leg. I forgot I burnt my leg with a curling iron yesterday. Guess that's not too good.
Kacey_Laine|So where do I go to turn off thoughts and feelings? I'm over them. They can leave. Thanks, goodbye.
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo Will you be in LA?!? If so, yes please!!
Kacey_Laine|@michellexxo COME BACK TO MEEEEE.
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip and happy anniversary. Tell my best friend I say hello 😐
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip get off your phone.
Kacey_Laine|I'm locked outside of @meghanrosette's apartment. Is this a joke? 😐
Kacey_Laine|My Internet is a joke.
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie Hahahah seriously though! At every mall there is a group of consistent mall walkers ;)
Kacey_Laine|@wu_angie Hahahah they must have been finishing up their walks :)
Kacey_Laine|@emilycallori Saturday for sure, and possibly Sunday! :)
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip Mine was funny...but that's because I'm just naturally funny.
Kacey_Laine|@emilycallori Yes!!
Kacey_Laine|Who goes to the mall at 11am on a Tuesday? Old ladies who are briskly walking. Moms trying to control their toddlers. And me.
Kacey_Laine|I got my hair caught in the car door. This is not a joke. This is real life 😐
Kacey_Laine|I've been awake for almost 2 hours and I have yet to get out of bed. I have to be ready and out the door in an hour. Wish me luck.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu Hiiiii. I'm beautiful. And yayayayayyyy. 11 days till I see youuuuuu &lt;333
Kacey_Laine|I hate April Fool's Day. As if I don't have enough trust issues already 😐 #stayawayplease
Kacey_Laine|3:45am. Hi.
Kacey_Laine|I don't know how I'm supposed to feel right now.
Kacey_Laine|@hayleymaz I know. I've been walking around my apartment just trying to figure out how I feel.
Kacey_Laine|@hayleymaz literally yes.
Kacey_Laine|So many feels. And yes I cried. I don't know what to do now.
Kacey_Laine|It's only 8 minutes into the finale and I'm already starting to cry...I'm not ready for this.
Kacey_Laine|I'm ready to cry. Don't judge me 😭 #HIMYM
Kacey_Laine|@kairdv ahhhh I'm not ready for it to be over 😭😭😭 1 hour and 20 minutes for me 😭😭😭😭
Kacey_Laine|Currently looking for 4-5 people to be my best friends while we hang out at the coffee shop/bar. I want life to be like a 30 minute sitcom.
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu literally my life.
Kacey_Laine|Done with work. Now to brave the LA traffic home, where I will emotionally prepare myself for the HIMYM finale.
Kacey_Laine|How I Met Your Mother ends tonight. I'm not emotionally prepared for this. Excuse me while I cry in the corner all alone.
Kacey_Laine|SURPRISE! NEW VIDEO IS LIVE!! March 2014: Monthly Favorites ♥ http://t.co/rlRYziDeDw
Kacey_Laine|spring break...spring break foreverrrr https://t.co/c6w2DrxyM1
Kacey_Laine|So proud of @meghanrosette and all she has accomplished. This video is truly amazing &lt;33 https://t.co/AU4Mfrp3VJ
Kacey_Laine|I've come to realize that I'm really good at distancing myself from people, and then wondering why I'm always alone.
Kacey_Laine|@emcr8ton Already done :)
Kacey_Laine|@alessiamaria_ Hahahah good because I def do that way too much ;)
Kacey_Laine|@jessicachu TAKE ME WITH YOU. But yes, yes you do.
Kacey_Laine|@CarlieStylezz megashare.sh is where I watched all of them :)
Kacey_Laine|I just worked out. Do I now have permission to lay in bed and watch Scandal for the rest of the day? I don't care. I'm doing it anyway.
Kacey_Laine|@fashionlife83 Besties4Lifeeeee :D
Kacey_Laine|@lisaflip @MakeupbyMandy24 LET'S GO!

Kacey_Laine|@emilyjune_ Your morning routine? Loved it &lt;33 https://t.co/MRZTp3q81U #missyoubebe
Kacey_Laine|Congratulations to @tyleroakley for raising over $500,000 for @TrevorProject! It's amazing to see the power that YouTube has in this world&lt;3
Kacey_Laine|@sugarplumjerri Like putting peanut butter on a spoon and eating it like that? Because I'm like really good at that.
Kacey_Laine|Replying to some comments on my newest video! I've missed chatting with y'all. Come say hi! https://t.co/c6w2DrxyM1
Kacey_Laine|@missglamorazzi Ohmygoodness, your apartment is absolute perfection!! Love it so so much! And @A_Fab_Life is amazing &lt;33
Kacey_Laine|I feel like I need to start wearing pants in my apartment now with these earthquakes happening. Like should I be better prepared/clothed? 😐

Kacey_Laine|@payday1234 Hahaha not at alllll :))
Kacey_Laine|Wait. Like actually though. 11 hours? Is this an April Fools' Day prank? Because they're a few days early. http://t.co/G6zDAm3myv

alexfjterranova|Regardless of what people say, I know who I am and who I want to be. No set backs. No losses. Learning and losing at the same time is a win

alexfjterranova|It's a vibe yeah
alexfjterranova|Actually nah, let's be great together. Happy Friday ✌🏼❤️
alexfjterranova|Separation and the vitality between the two is so important. Be great
alexfjterranova|Success that's a given. That's something that will come if you're willing to work for it.
alexfjterranova|I guarantee you if you stick to being an example and being true to your values, it's the greatest way to live for your soul.
alexfjterranova|Role model first, success second. Both are something you earn but only one of them is something more valuable
alexfjterranova|If you don't speak up for yourself, people will take away what you've already earned. It's not an I owe you, it's an I owe it to myself

alexfjterranova|Better question, what're you doing today to be great to one another?
alexfjterranova|What're you doing today to be great?
alexfjterranova|"@sierrashyland No need to be sorry. I'm not ""Bane"" from batman 😂"
alexfjterranova|@TrainingMask I get a ton of questions and looks whenever I train with my mask on. Only if they knew it makes you chase greatness 🤔
alexfjterranova|@sierrashyland It's a piece of equipment that helps me train and run longer. Nothing to be afraid of 😊
alexfjterranova|10k time 🏃🏻
alexfjterranova|Shout out to my bank @Chase for having my back. Appreciate the great customer service
alexfjterranova|@stophiscrying Got you 😊
alexfjterranova|This is even a message I need to remind myself of everyday. Let's be great together
alexfjterranova|We need to value encouragement rather than showing who is right. Imagine a world where we are open minded to each other's opinions
alexfjterranova|lol you're welcome. I want free deliveries too 😂 https://t.co/IKJaKKS1OB
alexfjterranova|Here’s $100 in FREE Postmates delivery fee credit (good for 7 days). Sign up with my code 3I47I or this link https://t.co/JM4JTa35bp

alexfjterranova|Van Nuys🛩Vegas
alexfjterranova|@unlostharry Wish you luck x100 😎
alexfjterranova|Faith is one thing... but it is nothing without love
alexfjterranova|The @priverevaux launch party was a great time. Everyone I met most likely heard me say  @sierra_furtado is my fiancé 😂 #ProudSoonToBeHubby
alexfjterranova|So I saw OBJ again tonight... yeah I'm a fangirl 😂
alexfjterranova|@angies_diary @sierra_furtado Got you! Hope high school finals weren't too tough! Welcome to adulthood 😊
alexfjterranova|@grethangrier But it did 😎
alexfjterranova|Who wants a vlog today?
alexfjterranova|@jusducks6 I like the sound of that! Would be great for the NHL having the Predators win! I feel a comeback
alexfjterranova|@jusducks6 Omg 😂😂😂 Layton what's up! Hope all is well my man. Who you got winning the cup?
alexfjterranova|Grateful for this temp phone but... I need a bigger screen
alexfjterranova|Going from an iPhone 6Plus to a iPhone SE is pretty frustrating 😂
alexfjterranova|Damn phone broke, damn car has an oil leak, damn student loan... give me a damn break today lol
alexfjterranova|Feels good to be in Hollywood again 😊
alexfjterranova|@BlueMaillard @sierrafurtado Most likely tomorrow or Thursday 😊

alexfjterranova|This should have been my first tweet of the day... well actually everyday... but thank you to the brave men and women of this country 🇺🇸
alexfjterranova|@JeanineAmapola @sierra_furtado Just when I thought it can't get any better 🙌🏼
alexfjterranova|So many good questions! Keep them coming 😊 https://t.co/OGjEXu77uC
alexfjterranova|Tweet me and @sierra_furtado some questions you have about our engagement, the proposal, or anything else for the final 5th video 😊 Q&amp;A
alexfjterranova|Good morning ☕️
alexfjterranova|I would say this video we're posting less in 30 min is the most emotional video for me.. well the proposal video maybe a hair more 😂❤️😊
alexfjterranova|We aren't perfect. We will still deal with anger and hate including myself. But it's not about how you start, it's about finishing with love
alexfjterranova|I'm feeling this talk...
alexfjterranova|If you're dealing with an issue, look at everything around you. Don't value what will only help you but what will help each other
alexfjterranova|I never witnessed hate winning... only LOVE can win because it always does
alexfjterranova|We are meant to love our differences because we are all brought to life for different and unique reasons
alexfjterranova|It's easy for people to hate because our world doesn't value the importance of love.
alexfjterranova|Pray for OUR world
alexfjterranova|Pray away violence
alexfjterranova|Pray for Egypt
alexfjterranova|Yo let's take the time to realize how beautiful my fiancé is though... damn... I love saying that... fiancé @sierra_furtado

alexfjterranova|Most times they'll say you don't fit this or you aren't right for it.. if you believe in you and work hard. They'll wish they never spoke
alexfjterranova|Life advice: don't let anyone tell you what you can't do. Believe you can and do it

alexfjterranova|But hey! At least my @Mets are winning 😎
alexfjterranova|Tough watching this @NYRangers
alexfjterranova|.@Mets are they at your game!?!
alexfjterranova|So I'm waiting for the New York Rangers to show up but all I see on the ice is their goalie Henrik Lundqvist
alexfjterranova|Mets walk off win! Great finish and a great Monday 😎
alexfjterranova|So happy to have gone to @hillsongLA this morning. Happy to be back home in LA 😊
alexfjterranova|Y'all have a great day or night. I'm so lost with time at the moment 😂✌🏼❤️
alexfjterranova|Not to give too much information, but I thought it would give everyone a laugh. A mosquito bit my bum and I just wanna scratch my ass 😂
alexfjterranova|@grilledhemmings I would think so! Some people don't get that. But glad there are people like you who understand 😊
alexfjterranova|lol I'm gonna get hated for loving my country. No shade to other countries. I just love where I'm from

alexfjterranova|Woke up on this side of the world to find out the @Mets lost 23-5... what the heck is going on over there... 😡
alexfjterranova|Clearly I'm tired* of the world
alexfjterranova|Anyways... good morning on the side of the world I'm from. Goodnight from the side of the I'm at currently 🌎😊💤🌏
alexfjterranova|I get there are jokes but some come off as bullying rather than being funny. Respect each other
alexfjterranova|Just because it's 2017 doesn't make it right to say anything you want. What happened to respect?
alexfjterranova|That's 5 if you don't know military time. I'm questioning if some of the islanders know or if they debate time based off the sun 😂
alexfjterranova|Hmm I wonder what happened to 17:00 🤔
alexfjterranova|Today seems like a day where we can't get anything really on our side 😂 thankfully we know we're lucky most other days
alexfjterranova|Can't nap all the time but when you have spare time and nothing else do, why the heck not if you're feeling it? 💤
alexfjterranova|I don't care what anyone says about not napping or not liking it... NAPS are the greatest

alexfjterranova|LAX✈️Dubai
alexfjterranova|Life ain't easy, you create your luck
alexfjterranova|Can't please everyone. People will take advantage when you try and will expect more instead of giving it in return
alexfjterranova|Everyone wants me to worry about them, I can't even worry about myself at the moment lol
alexfjterranova|And moving on... hope y'all are having an amazing day! 😎
alexfjterranova|And I'm talking about in all areas of life. Relationships, business, sports, music, and the list goes on
alexfjterranova|"Focus on being creative on whatever you're doing rather than ""success"". That'll come with whatever you're passionate about putting out"
alexfjterranova|In my opinion, the most creative things are made or thought of when we lose sight of how it can benefit whatever you're creating
alexfjterranova|Shoutout to my brother @TrainWithPj for making me better and for another boxing workout! Haven't been that shaky in a lonnnng time 😅

alexfjterranova|@kjredmond2001 I don't know about them but if I'm salty it's probably because I'm eating too much peanut butter right now 😂

alexfjterranova|@11SMALLS11 look out for the next tweet 😊
alexfjterranova|@judahsmith ready for week 5 tonight @thecitychurch #HowsYourSoul

alexfjterranova|@mari_vulova1 amazing 😊 thank you for asking. And how are you? I hope the same!
alexfjterranova|Is that the sun in LA!?! 😩🌤🙏🏼😎
alexfjterranova|Summer is on my mind
alexfjterranova|My heart has been with God all day. Hope y'all had a great Sunday too 🙌🏼
alexfjterranova|@kjredmond2001 @sierra_furtado ❤
alexfjterranova|I prefer to be the underdog 😈
alexfjterranova|Why do I always forget about Snapchat? Lol
alexfjterranova|@salmaanwarr have an amazing night 😴😂😊
alexfjterranova|Have an amazing day 😀
alexfjterranova|And if our God is for us.. who can stop us?
alexfjterranova|I would say the last 3 weeks have been some of the strangest but most valuable lessons I've learned. Can't take that for granted
alexfjterranova|@KygoMusic and @selenagomez made a smash #ItAintMe
alexfjterranova|@ruckusapparel yes!!!!
alexfjterranova|"@ruckusapparel it's ""modeling"" duh 😂😂😂"
alexfjterranova|The only man I want to be is the one that's true to my heart
alexfjterranova|Late to Church today but made it on time for l the message being preached. Loved it! Happy Sunday!
alexfjterranova|LA is so sunny and warm today!!! Loving this weather 😊
alexfjterranova|Want a good movie? Watch True Story with @JamesFrancoTV and @JonahHill. Intense, thrilling, and it leaves you thinking 🤔
alexfjterranova|Check out @Hallmark to get your own cards this Valentine's Day and tag your extraordinary person with… https://t.co/5ohYJvf2IP
alexfjterranova|Love always wins
alexfjterranova|wanna get lost today 💭
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco when's my flight? 😏
alexfjterranova|@fluffypenguin18 @sierra_furtado no little fly to me. I see a giant heart ☺
alexfjterranova|And yes I got that last part from @BigSean 😂 his album is inspiring to me
alexfjterranova|Feeling really loved today. I'm so lucky. God thank you for my set backs
alexfjterranova|The Hangover is on TV. Bless up! Favorite comedic movies 🙌🏼
alexfjterranova|When Postmates sends you free delivery all day but you don't have Postmates in your area anymore 😩
alexfjterranova|Watch Brady rush for the winning TD 😂
alexfjterranova|I love games like this #SuperBowl
alexfjterranova|Tom Brady and amazing catches like that is why I don't doubt the Pats 😂 https://t.co/XUK6DwOBmO
alexfjterranova|Unreal 😱
alexfjterranova|Easy to say, hard to do. Let's just be human beings and work on it together
alexfjterranova|Be you and be the best example without pride of how you feel you can help others around you
alexfjterranova|There is no making a point by proving someone wrong. Making a point is influencing others to love and forgive each other
alexfjterranova|Why do we expect others to be perfect when nobody will be perfect? Why are we satisfied to prove others wrong instead of helping one another
alexfjterranova|Everyone either has a broken past or a broken present. Doesn't mean there will be a broken future. Have faith
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco love you bro
alexfjterranova|@angies_diary be you and love others around you! Don't feel pressured by anything, God welcomes EVERYONE 😊
alexfjterranova|Don't care who wins but my pick is the Pats 😬 would love a new team like ATL but I don't think anyone but the Giants can beat New England 😂
alexfjterranova|@angies_diary I like Kanye's creativity 😊
alexfjterranova|@BarbGrm ❤
alexfjterranova|Loving @BigSean new album. Haven't felt connected to an album in so long. Love when you can feel that way about music 🔥
alexfjterranova|@BigSean I decided 🔥🔥🔥 this music is a blessing.
alexfjterranova|You don't need anyone's validation or acceptance to be a good person. Spread love and positivity
alexfjterranova|What a Beautiful Name 🙌🏼
alexfjterranova|@lamelaza_7 has been pumping me up all offseason for 2017! Workouts and progress looks great!!! #LGM #UnfinishedBusiness
alexfjterranova|February is a tease... can we get to March and April please? So much on my mind! Spring Training, travel, festivals, Opening Day.... 😏
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco https://t.co/gJFfaLZlfJ
alexfjterranova|Who does everyone have winning the Super Bowl? I'll tweet my pick Friday 😈
alexfjterranova|I've been debating who I think will win the Super Bowl but I can't decide. I would like change but I have so much respect for Tom Brady 🤔
alexfjterranova|Funny how weather can change your mood 🌞
alexfjterranova|Best times tonight brotha 🙏🏼 @darinblaine
alexfjterranova|Things I forget about. Texting people back, Snapchat, texting people back, laundry, texting people back... 😂
alexfjterranova|My heart and my intentions will always and forever be to make others around me smile
alexfjterranova|Blessed everyday I get up. Life tip: be the best person you can be. What's your motivation? 👊🏼
alexfjterranova|Day is great though and I love @sierra_furtado ☺💕
alexfjterranova|Why not ask someone what they mean instead of pointing the finger and calling them names. It's probably opposite of their intention 🤔
alexfjterranova|I think there are a lot of problems in the world because people want to take things out of context and create a problem rather discussing it
alexfjterranova|Might of made a few mistakes and had a few lessons to be learned but my heart always knew what was right. Thankful for those in my life
alexfjterranova|I try to not be prideful about things that happen in my life but one thing I am very proud of is that I didn't change who I am for LA.
alexfjterranova|Now I don't have to hesitate to say no, I just laugh and say no
alexfjterranova|Morning!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco see you soon!
alexfjterranova|Bro @MichaelNorco come to LA so we can watch the bachelor together
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco you officially lost me to my girlfriend 💕😜
alexfjterranova|Corrine and Chad should date #TheBachelor
alexfjterranova|@taybahzar2 ❤

alexfjterranova|It's simple... PRAY. You can never go wrong with a simple prayer and having faith.
alexfjterranova|Love rainy days
alexfjterranova|Just wondering... who is team Snapchat still? I feel like I'm team Insta with the story 😂 they just need a better camera and filters

alexfjterranova|We're working on it to make it better. We care about what we post and hopefully we can post the video from yesterday for today :)
alexfjterranova|So I promised a video yesterday and it didn't happen... I'm so sorry! Final cut is deleting clips and it's making our vlogs confusing!
alexfjterranova|@maryamhaddads I am so sorry! Something came up holding us back from posting it yesterday 😢 I'm hoping today we get it fixed!
alexfjterranova|Me and @sierra_furtado have a bet that if my @nyknicks beat the @Raptors tonight I can get a gaming counsel! 😂🙌🏼🇺🇸 #NYKatTOR
alexfjterranova|The vlog that's about to go up today on our channel might be my favorite we've ever done. Probably our longest video also 🇺🇸🇨🇦

alexfjterranova|Had a Dunk A Roo for the first time in years! #ChildhoodMemories

alexfjterranova|What a game!
alexfjterranova|LAX✈️VAN
alexfjterranova|Update: on the squat rack. Thank you sweet baby Jesus!

alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco I mean sometimes our workouts were so good we would ditch and grab ice cream 😂
alexfjterranova|Last night we watched Mean Girls, built ginger bread houses, played games like hide and seek. Haven't felt that alive in a long time 😂#23
alexfjterranova|@VanaBakalian @dylanobrien thank you! He's one of my favorite actors and also one of my inspirations!

alexfjterranova|Everyone needs a friend like @TrainWithPj. Blessed to call this guy a brother. Always encouraging and loving. Bless you bro
alexfjterranova|I guarantee you that the love you give, will be given in return ❤️
alexfjterranova|Your person is out there. You never know when you're going to meet them, but you will
alexfjterranova|Absolutely feel for people when they've been crushed by another person. Sometimes we don't see what's right in front of us. But good news...
alexfjterranova|@sierra_furtado this one too! 😂 https://t.co/lrHq2AgfqL
alexfjterranova|Waiting on @sierra_furtado like https://t.co/HksW32a96F
alexfjterranova|Nobody is perfect, but we should strive to be the best person we can be. Live life with love and encouragement! Have the best day 😊
alexfjterranova|Why do people feel the need to comment negative things? Is it really brightening your day? I bet your life is as negative as your comment 😂
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco typo error in the tweet. Really should of said I miss Michael Norco 💙
alexfjterranova|Life without @Postmates would be rough... but it would also mean $200 more in my bank account every month 😂
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco @Basebalfan330 it's gonna happen, only a matter of time 😎
alexfjterranova|@Therealmelxo feeling AMAZING! You?
alexfjterranova|All honesty... I feel like @RunRalphieRun got robbed in rankings this week. At least should be ranked 6th... #GoBuffs

alexfjterranova|@SierraReynoldss everything will be good 😊 thank you for checking in
alexfjterranova|I'm good... there's positivity in everything if you really look into it
alexfjterranova|Worst news... is the news you wish you didn't hear or find out about
alexfjterranova|@shaira_lais 😂 this actually helped.
alexfjterranova|Such a sick feeling to my stomach... wow out of no where... 😞
alexfjterranova|@BigSean #BounceBack is 🔥🔥🔥 definitely new road work music 💪🏼

alexfjterranova|#McGregor 👊🏼
alexfjterranova|I rather be hated for being myself instead of doing fake things for people's  approval.
alexfjterranova|@MelTBal @GabrielConte @jessb @sierra_furtado hmmm 🤔 I do love them together and their vlogs... 😎
alexfjterranova|@QuincyFouse 🙌🏼
alexfjterranova|Slow to anger, slow to speak... we need open minded people who are willing to hear other opinions without pointing fingers #AllForLove
alexfjterranova|@aniafc stop acting like people who are white, straight, and Christian don't care about what's going on. I'm ALL FOR LOVE
alexfjterranova|@IoserIexi if you were really the things you supported, you wouldn't be acting the way you are to a fellow human being with an opinion.
alexfjterranova|@Kaackattack I'm all for love and positive energy. I tweeted several tweets afterwards just so people know I'm for humanity and love
alexfjterranova|@AllTrapNation family! Congrats on 10 mil. Truly an accomplishment and amazing what you do for undiscovered artists. It's about the music
alexfjterranova|"""Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humanity value others above yourself."" Philippians 2:3-4"
alexfjterranova|@IoserIexi you're sadly what needs to change. You really didn't give me a chance of what I said but refer to me as… https://t.co/OJsYThoRlg
alexfjterranova|Final thoughts on the Election since apparently I'm hated for my right to have an opinion... 🇺🇸 https://t.co/TwOBPh5TGL
alexfjterranova|Another thing, just be a good person. No need to call people names for their right to have an opinion. Night Twitter
alexfjterranova|I love America and people, I just try to find positives instead of complain about it. It's not going to change anything.
alexfjterranova|@carleigh_crazy I'm rich? Really.. why do I have debt from my college loans? Educate yourself and don't make assumptions about me
alexfjterranova|Also WE as a NATION make America great. I didn't support either candidates but I'm proud to be American. Be grateful
alexfjterranova|@KerickSullivan thank you bro!
alexfjterranova|"I'm sorry but Twitter y'all are driving me crazy. This country will ALWAYS be ""The Land of the Free"" regardless who is in charge."

alexfjterranova|Don't feel like you have to sacrifice family for work. If the work is meant to be, the timing will be meant to be. Prioritize what matters
alexfjterranova|@Noahsyndergaard I got the horse named after you today in race 8. I hope it brings the heat like you do! #BreedersCup
alexfjterranova|One thing I do love about social media, is connecting with the world. But living and connecting are completely different. Be YOU! 😎
alexfjterranova|Cracks me up when people live their life through social media. At the end of the day it's a number. What matters is who is standing by you
alexfjterranova|Morning ☕️ could use some good thoughts and prayers my way today. Have an amazing day!
alexfjterranova|And last thing, she's so adorable and an amazing soul. There should be nothing but love for you @sierra_furtado
alexfjterranova|I'm so thankful for the person you are. I'll never take away the credit for the things you've blessed me with. I love you @sierra_furtado
alexfjterranova|If it wasn't for @sierra_furtado my life would be way different. She's my hero like many of yours. Never take someone like this for granted
alexfjterranova|Tell you what... gonna be making some changes. Key changes
alexfjterranova|@swaguarrr @sierra_furtado we love you. Thank you for being so kind 😊
alexfjterranova|https://t.co/NzHA9szWNq
alexfjterranova|Hats off to both teams. But for real I'm going to bed and retiring from twitter. Sorry for all the tweets. Helped release so many emotions 😂
alexfjterranova|Congrats to the Cubs... didn't make it easy but they did it. What a game!
alexfjterranova|Best #WorldSeries I've ever watched
alexfjterranova|@alexxandra_28 as for me and I'm pretty sure most people 😂
alexfjterranova|Are you kidding 😂
alexfjterranova|@sierraschai I don't care who wins because I'm a Mets fan. But I did think the Indians..
alexfjterranova|If the Cubs don't win this game now... they are for sure a cursed team
alexfjterranova|Wow 😳
alexfjterranova|Best game I've ever witnessed. All the dramatics and now this rain delay in game 7... are we watching a movie or??? #WorldSeries
alexfjterranova|This rain delay is gonna change the tempo of the game for both teams.
alexfjterranova|@myaamartinezz of course! I've been in the gym for 2 hrs and can't leave until it's over 😂 I don't want to miss anything
alexfjterranova|🔥🔥🔥
alexfjterranova|Amazing
alexfjterranova|Whoever was trying to correct me and say home field advantage doesn't matter in baseball. My point proven
alexfjterranova|I love baseball
alexfjterranova|Me every pitch in emojis... 😐😳🙃😅😶😳😱😅😁
alexfjterranova|Wow!
alexfjterranova|@KerickSullivan 😂
alexfjterranova|All in all, baseball is sooo damn 😍 as a fan of the game I love what the Cubs and Indians have done this year. Whoever wins deserves it
alexfjterranova|Game 7! Honestly don't care who wins. I would love to see the Cubs make history, but my gut is telling me the Indians will #WorldSeries
alexfjterranova|Gotta say, those Cubbies are impressive. Did not think they would be this hot #ProvenWrong
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco picture with Santa, The Holiday Armadillo, and Superman 😎 https://t.co/p3PxLnAa5s
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco https://t.co/LBkzDehCVt
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco best times! 2016 Christmas pic? 😏
alexfjterranova|I love when people think @MichaelNorco is joking about something but you know him so well to know that he isn't 😂 #MariahCareyChristmas
alexfjterranova|Speak slow to anger, stick up for yourself when needed, and be as kind as you can when something nice is given. Good vibes. Happy November!
alexfjterranova|Not saying I'm a Tribe fan either, I just think clearly they are the hotter and better team. I got Cleveland tonight to win it all
alexfjterranova|@RealSkipBayless @undisputed I like your point on CHI but baseball is a game where home field advantage is key. Past doesn't matter #CLE
alexfjterranova|Editing videos is seriously therapeutic for me... I love this
alexfjterranova|@angies_diary yes please 😋
alexfjterranova|Sports rant over 😂 Happy Sunday! Have the best day ever!
alexfjterranova|And yet what a time to be alive in Cleveland... Cavs and Indians are on board. Only if the Browns understood the concept of competing for 💍🏆
alexfjterranova|Not trying to throw shade at Cleveland but really the Browns are the worst franchise in all of sports.
alexfjterranova|Yes we came back for the first time in history down 13-0 at the half to win but beating the Browns is like a getting a participation trophy
alexfjterranova|Being a Jets fan can be frustrating... like yeah we won and I'm happy but why are we raving about beating the Browns? They are 0-8...
alexfjterranova|@AllisonShaw02 thank you! You make us so happy!
alexfjterranova|Would be nice to go home... but @flyLAXairport insists that as soon as you arrive you wait 20 more min on the runway lol
alexfjterranova|SF✈️LAX
alexfjterranova|I never dreamed about finding my way to the top without helping other around me. This is truly what it's about. We'll get through it ❤️
alexfjterranova|I promise I'll get back to you at some point. I know the pain, thoughts, and battle you're dealing with.
alexfjterranova|So many of you have reached out to me with very personal topics. I feel so fortunate that many of you trust and had the courage to reach out
alexfjterranova|@LAbeatzz I'm actually on my way back for some more! 😉 lol thank you for the candy it was so good and made my day!

alexfjterranova|So stoked for San Fran tomorrow. Love it when work let's you travel ✈️
alexfjterranova|And yes I'm talking about @sierra_furtado. I don't understand sometimes why me. She's perfect in my eyes

alexfjterranova|Gonna respond to a lot of DMs tomorrow 😊
alexfjterranova|@youtosetmefree thank you! All about growing and learning together. People like you who notice I'm trying my best motivates me! 😊

alexfjterranova|When @sierra_furtado is the first row, window seat on the plane and your the last row, middle seat on the plane because of your bags 🙄🤔
alexfjterranova|LAX✈️DEN
alexfjterranova|The best things happen when you least expect them
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco you'll be seeing that tweet soon 😏
alexfjterranova|JFK✈️LAX
alexfjterranova|@helloitsaudreyy ❤️ thank you ☺️
alexfjterranova|You all have the best day ever. Gonna be a great day with @sierra_furtado

alexfjterranova|Coffee sounds great
alexfjterranova|@Delta help @sierra_furtado and I get this camera back we left on our flight to NY!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
alexfjterranova|LAX✈️JFK
alexfjterranova|So excited for the things I know I have to work hard for 🙏🏼
alexfjterranova|@swaguarrr holy throwback lol
alexfjterranova|Ahhh... love my dad. Greatest man I know. Hate saying goodbyes and wish this guy could be living in California. See you soon &amp; love you pops
alexfjterranova|Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire 🎧
alexfjterranova|@andrealexiaa great way to improve your endurance, strength, and focus during cardio. You'll feel the result within 3 times of using it 😊
alexfjterranova|Absolutely stunned about Jose Fernandez. Unbelievable talent for baseball and I'm sure a great man. In Gods beautiful and resting hands #RIP
alexfjterranova|SEA✈️LAX
alexfjterranova|@angies_diary thank you ☺️
alexfjterranova|About to hit this runway for @voguemagazine 😎
alexfjterranova|But more importantly I wanna wish this beauty, who is my best friend, the best birthday ever. Love you… https://t.co/VoYJSM4dSu
alexfjterranova|On her birthday but I want to thank her with all my heart for her love and support. I wouldn't be here without this amazing girl we know(⬆️)
alexfjterranova|Bae's birthday is today!!! 😍 We're in Seattle this weekend because I had to work and I know Sierra had to make a sacrifice and come up(⬆️)
alexfjterranova|LAX✈️SEA
alexfjterranova|Making moves and changes today 😎
alexfjterranova|I love listening to @MichaelNorco late night voicemails the next day 😂 love you bro
alexfjterranova|Never take life for granted, remember to appreciate those around you who make you smile, and never lose sight of the little things
alexfjterranova|We are all blessed regardless of the place or situation we're in. Those who realize it become more blessed and run with it.
alexfjterranova|God, my girlfriend, my parents, my sister, my pups, and my best friends. They are who give me purpose and inspire me to want more.
alexfjterranova|New week, new day, new opportunities. You decide when it's your time. Let's be great
alexfjterranova|@ColleenftJoey snacks and drinks on you! 😉
alexfjterranova|It means we aren't perfect. That we have a lot more to learn. More to be patient and forgiving. And most importantly more to love.
alexfjterranova|Sometimes we let our pride or our dignity get the best of us... Doesn't mean we are bad people or that it defines us.
alexfjterranova|I'm done ✌🏼️
alexfjterranova|Comparing the past to your present will get you no where in life. Justifying your reasoning is living in fear. Have faith
alexfjterranova|Even if you're against the idea, true love works it's way against the odds because you're willing to fight for it together
alexfjterranova|Bottom line, if you love someone you don't have expectations or hold them to what they can and can't do.
alexfjterranova|Don't say you love me but you'll resent me for something that's just a thought at the moment
alexfjterranova|If you don't have faith that things are different or will be different with someone, you don't have trust for them
alexfjterranova|Go watch my beautiful girlfriend's NEW video on her main YouTube channel. So proud and so good!!! Love you @sierra_furtado 😘
alexfjterranova|Lol my rant is over. I'm pumped on life and hope you are too. Lots of love, night Twitter 👆🏼
alexfjterranova|I won't be second and I won't feel like I need to be the best. I want to create, inspire, and be the BEST for you
alexfjterranova|Not afraid what's to come. I'm going to do everything I can to make my dream a reality.
alexfjterranova|Lacing up the gloves and ready to put up a fight. Knocked down, knocked down again, but I'm getting back up and gonna give my everything
alexfjterranova|I have dreams too ya know
alexfjterranova|@kidlawl_ the lucky guy will come when you least expect it. You deserve the love you give. Never let anyone make you feel less than that 😊
alexfjterranova|@myaamartinezz one day! We'll make it happen
alexfjterranova|@angies_diary hmm maybe!! It seems fun but I don't know 🙃
alexfjterranova|Happy Sunday 😜
alexfjterranova|Proud boyfriend
alexfjterranova|Watching @sierra_furtado do her thing with editing, filming, or anything @YouTube related... Is like watching Jordan play basketball 😳🔥😅

alexfjterranova|@QueenLida101 I think today is fitting since it's my bday 😉
alexfjterranova|Don't do things because you feel you need the attention. Do them because you know it can greatly impact someones life for a better direction
alexfjterranova|LV✈️LAX
alexfjterranova|At UFC 202 now. I have McGregor. Who you got? 😜 #UFC202

alexfjterranova|Life is great even when you feel like you're at your lowest. Have a great weekend
alexfjterranova|It amazes me how time goes by, to see the people who stand by your side, and the love you feel for the little things.
alexfjterranova|@bella_snds not going anywhere ☺️
alexfjterranova|I have a vision that one day, all those things I believe that drive me and give me purpose are going to happen.
alexfjterranova|What gives you purpose?
alexfjterranova|What drives you?
alexfjterranova|@hayleyfaith1 @sierra_furtado don't search! It'll come when you least expect it 😊

alexfjterranova|Me and @sierra_furtado have another vlog coming for ya tonight 😎
alexfjterranova|DEN✈️VAN
alexfjterranova|@AngieLoves80s it makes sense to me. Thank you for making my night ☺️
alexfjterranova|But thanks to the people who are kind and who actually don't care about expressing their opinions for attention. You motivate me to be good
alexfjterranova|"If I wasn't so nice I would put a lot of people who feel the need to ""express"" their opinion in their place."
alexfjterranova|Some people comment things thinking it gets to me... Nah. I find it funny and ridiculous.
alexfjterranova|😂 https://t.co/nD21l4gRTE
alexfjterranova|@heyyitscam_ I love Boulder! Might be there tomorrow 😉
alexfjterranova|@heyyitscam_ pretty much born and raised in Thornton 😊
alexfjterranova|Feels good to be back home in Colorado for the weekend 🙂
alexfjterranova|CHI✈️DEN
alexfjterranova|Hope you all have a great day 😎
alexfjterranova|Sorry for my excitement for this... I actually was nervous at first 😂 I'm honestly just thankful and grateful
alexfjterranova|"I feel like I've been missing out, like it's one of those things your parents keep
from you because you'll love it too much"
alexfjterranova|Flying first class for the first time.... I never want to go back to regular seating... And it's only been 20 min in flight 😭🙏🏼☺️
alexfjterranova|LA✈️CHI
alexfjterranova|"""Fix my eyes on the things I can't see now"" #chills"
alexfjterranova|@Ray_Banz4 you'll look good in orange in blue, just trying to put you in colors that you pull off lol miss you man
alexfjterranova|@Ray_Banz4 you also need to wear that Mets cap and own up to our bet
alexfjterranova|"Does his set, ""okay it'll settle for a churro."" 😂😂😂 @Rapsac38"
alexfjterranova|"At the gym with Caspar and he says, ""yeah my fat isn't thinking exercise right now.. It's thinking ice cream..."" @Rapsac38"
alexfjterranova|Always a warm feeling walking into @flatironschurch. Definitely one of the things that makes Colorado home. Have a great day
alexfjterranova|@myheartnoel @sierra_furtado 😂😂😂 my bad.
alexfjterranova|Keep rude comments to yourself, be kind to others, and have a great day :) as simple as that
alexfjterranova|Sometimes I feel the need to make a point to bullies, even though they are only saying things for attention
alexfjterranova|I know I shouldn't comment back to hateful and rude comments on social media. But I don't stand for bullying.
alexfjterranova|Great things happening, I feel a turn in direction ☺️ #ThankYouGod
alexfjterranova|LA✈️DEN
alexfjterranova|Too much at once
alexfjterranova|@darinblaine @jackiessays thank you and miss you 🙏🏼❤️😭
alexfjterranova|@darinblaine why didn't you say so earlier. On my way #LateNightCuddles
alexfjterranova|Rant over. Have a good day
alexfjterranova|Be kind to others always, regardless of what they've done to you... Don't say things behind people's backs that you can't say to their face
alexfjterranova|I get we are all hypocritical over plenty of things in life, but don't act like you're royalty and live a perfect life.
alexfjterranova|Maybe solve your issues first before worrying about who is fake and who is living their life
alexfjterranova|"I find it funny when someone tweets, ""I find it rare to find genuine people who live their life,"" but yet they talk behind people's back"
alexfjterranova|The 5 highway from LA to Anaheim is garbage 🙄
alexfjterranova|Really don't want to make my way back into Hollywood today... But business is business. Gotta make those moves
alexfjterranova|@nluk10 miss you little bro
alexfjterranova|So proud of my baby @sierra_furtado #vidcon2016 is nuts 😁

alexfjterranova|@summie_smile hope you get what you want. I'll say a prayer for you 😊
alexfjterranova|Opportunities.... I'm hopeful 🙏🏼
alexfjterranova|I love the feeling of knowing you're loved by someone
alexfjterranova|@sierra_furtado because you are ❤️
alexfjterranova|I don't have time for rude comments or toxic energy.... Especially if it's on social media. Be kind, love others, and have a good day ☺️
alexfjterranova|Rainy day in NYC.... I ain't complaining. This city is beautiful no matter what
alexfjterranova|"@SportsCenter @MichaelNorco ""big man on campus"" 😂"

alexfjterranova|Agreed @sierra_furtado https://t.co/wUGkITZZb4
alexfjterranova|@HOODXMAYNARD got you 😊
alexfjterranova|The key to any relationship is honesty. If you want it to be strong, hold each other accountable for bigger and better plans
alexfjterranova|People wanna assume things, let them. Nothing is going to change what's real
alexfjterranova|Downtown LA and the moon tonight 😍
alexfjterranova|Back to those positive vibes though, have a great day everyone
alexfjterranova|Some models can be such a disgrace to this industry. And people wonder why modeling is dying... Smh
alexfjterranova|The more they hate, the more love I'll give back
alexfjterranova|I find it amusing haters will take time out of their day to leave comments, send messages, or stalk your page... Productive use of time
alexfjterranova|What a time to be alive
alexfjterranova|I honestly have the best girlfriend. So grateful for you @sierra_furtado
alexfjterranova|Nap time 🙏🏼
alexfjterranova|SAD or DAS? @darinblaine @sierra_furtado
alexfjterranova|@HOODXMAYNARD @sierra_furtado I wish.... We haven't even kissed yet.... 😉
alexfjterranova|Falling asleep to the sound of the waves&gt;
alexfjterranova|@sierra_furtado hehe sorry babe 😘

alexfjterranova|Thank you God. I love life
alexfjterranova|Today is going to be a great day... Dad comes into town... Church tonight with my girl #SundayFunday
alexfjterranova|@redturn2 @YasielPuig @PlayBall @MichaelNorco is that Caspar next to Puig? 😂
alexfjterranova|Can't sleep
alexfjterranova|Being a man isn't about saying how many girls you've been with, it's about finding the one you stick with.
alexfjterranova|Be a good person.... Rant over. Night Twitter
alexfjterranova|3. Don't let anyone ever categorize you or define you by how many followers you have.
alexfjterranova|2. Selfish thoughts will get you absolutely no where in this life
alexfjterranova|1. A man is nothing if he doesn't respect a woman's integrity
alexfjterranova|🙊
alexfjterranova|Insecure... We all are
alexfjterranova|@sierra_furtado take your Dodgers hat off. Let's go @Mets
alexfjterranova|Let's go @Mets

alexfjterranova|Happy Mother's Day to moms everywhere. Our world is powerful through your guidance and love
alexfjterranova|@Fer_1D_Lover @sierra_furtado I was blessed the moment she walked into my life... I got lucky one day
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco excited to see you tomorrow bro ❤️

alexfjterranova|@oldfashioned_s who me? 😉
alexfjterranova|@Coley_xoxd so disgusting 😷
alexfjterranova|Rant over
alexfjterranova|Also.... Vegan cheese isn't cheese. That's a disgrace to dairy products
alexfjterranova|Not trying to create a debate but, Vegan cheese is probably the most disgusting thing I've ever ate in my life.
alexfjterranova|Life is great when you make it great
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco love you bro

alexfjterranova|@Alex_Prange your snapchat story 😂😂😂
alexfjterranova|@WorIdStarComedy @MichaelNorco
alexfjterranova|Last tweet, not about anyone. Just an observation
alexfjterranova|People remember when you are shady... not the times you were nice. Remember that
alexfjterranova|@christian_rios thanks 😊 #143
alexfjterranova|Naps are the 🔑 to recovery

alexfjterranova|@wallflower_2013 hey hey hey 😎 thank you for being the sweetest ☺️
alexfjterranova|That right there is friendship goals
alexfjterranova|Most importantly though, who is going to hold you accountable and push you beyond your limits to reach your goals...
alexfjterranova|Also have to question yourself if you have their back
alexfjterranova|Some days you gotta question who in your life really has your back...
alexfjterranova|Is it just me or does Instagram seem like it's kind of going downhill?
alexfjterranova|@paigekrill @MichaelNorco
alexfjterranova|@christian_rios going to be a great year
alexfjterranova|God is good! Answered my prayers with my flight this morning! Lots of love to everyone today ☺️

alexfjterranova|@zaynmalik #PillowTalk 🔥🔥🔥
alexfjterranova|People be talking about how they want respect and what not but have to realize you have to give if you want to receive.
alexfjterranova|Whenever I get to eat is usually the highlight of my day

alexfjterranova|LA see you soon
alexfjterranova|Always two sides to a story
alexfjterranova|We're all going through a battle not everyone knows about. Be kind, supportive, and loving to each other
alexfjterranova|The sky is so beautiful right now
alexfjterranova|And yes... I'm a Christian and I believe in Jesus. But I believe in karma. Things will come back to get you. That's Gods redemption
alexfjterranova|Getting things done give positive feelings. Neglecting to do things, well it says it itself. Negative things happen
alexfjterranova|If you need a good laugh today... Add me on snapchat @ aTnova... Promise there's something there that'll make you laugh
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco @NFL @Vikings I knew it happened! Lol couldn't think of the damn kickers name
alexfjterranova|Other than the Chiefs blowing out the Texans, the playoffs this year has been 100 percent intense and shocking
alexfjterranova|@DrDan_11 😂😂😂
alexfjterranova|Disgraceful... To the fans who cheered for players getting hurt and to players intentional hurting other players
alexfjterranova|Praying for @AntonioBrown84.
alexfjterranova|Another cheap shot
alexfjterranova|Before the cheap hit and the brutal sack I was falling asleep... Wide awake now #playoffs
alexfjterranova|@hassel_arreola he needs to get shredded if he wants to act like he is on team Shredz and dating @PaigeHathaway. Big arms, tiny legs
alexfjterranova|@DrDan_11 love I don't know about the scruff part but the itchy neck... For sure feel your pain
alexfjterranova|@hassel_arreola not even trying to be a hater haha just so obnoxious
alexfjterranova|Just because you carry around a Shredz bag around the gym and have your bud take photos of you lifting, doesn't mean your sponsored by them
alexfjterranova|I really dislike you Rex Ryan
alexfjterranova|@SportsCenter @AZCardinals @DrDan_11
alexfjterranova|Fitz Magic to Marshall
alexfjterranova|Kept that promise. Fulfilling goals to start 2016 😎
alexfjterranova|I told a girl last night I wouldn't kiss her at midnight because I promised my mom to be my first kiss of the New Year...
alexfjterranova|I wish you only knew
alexfjterranova|@Alvinlwrnc thank you. Going to happen. Love you man
alexfjterranova|My dreams were ready for 2015. I've recognized my God-given talent. I'm working my tail off to… https://t.co/62tSeAQlwr
alexfjterranova|I know @DrDan_11 is pumped about that Bronco win
alexfjterranova|@GuyCodes @Alvinlwrnc 😂
alexfjterranova|Be strong, independent, and take the first step into something new.
alexfjterranova|Nobody feels sorry for you. You can keep thinking people will, but they won't. Don't drag anyone down with your problems. That's not right
alexfjterranova|You won't grow into something you want to be by throwing yourself a pity party.
alexfjterranova|If you hate where you are now, change. It's as simple as that.
alexfjterranova|J-E-T-S 🔥🔥🔥
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco 😂😂😂
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco Steve Harvey helped them
alexfjterranova|I thought the Pats were the luckiest team in the league... Giving some luck to the Jets!!! #LetsGo
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco I don't remember being there 😁
alexfjterranova|@MichaelNorco it looked like it was soooo fun
alexfjterranova|What do I do
alexfjterranova|@Basebalfan330 yes sir! Let's hope for it
alexfjterranova|All ball ref!!!
alexfjterranova|@Basebalfan330 good points on both. But Curry is a finisher and clutch... That's something Lebron rarely does
alexfjterranova|@Basebalfan330 ehh I respect Lebron. Never use to but can't deny how talented he is. Steph doesn't get enough credit for his defense though
alexfjterranova|@StephenCurry30 is a role model. Be like him kids
alexfjterranova|Whoever doesn't think @StephenCurry30 is the best player in the league is insane. @KingJames is right behind him but Steph does it all.
alexfjterranova|Just had a shot of tequila with my mom... ooooh boy
alexfjterranova|You're beautiful... drives me crazy what you want hasn't happen yet
alexfjterranova|Waking up with a sore throat... Probably one of the worst feelings. And then dealing with it all day
alexfjterranova|@DrDan_11 do you think it's weird our uber driver has a gps that calls her master? Or is it just me?
alexfjterranova|My sister was right... This lighting was on point so I had to take a selfie. Plus I'm very happy.… https://t.co/ttHXRLcwy8
alexfjterranova|Love my bro @MichaelNorco. Inspiration. Thankful for you
alexfjterranova|When bae comes back into town 😍😍😍 @MichaelNorco
alexfjterranova|@Ray_Banz4 on my way
alexfjterranova|Imperfections can often be some of the most beautiful things in a person
alexfjterranova|Colorado better have the exact same weather today next week on Christmas Day...
alexfjterranova|Aye I'm not even in school anymore and I got a snow day 😁
alexfjterranova|@DaniRay21 you're the sweetest thank you 😊
alexfjterranova|@DaniRay21 amen, praying for these sickos
alexfjterranova|Also... No those are not my nudes. I've never taken a nude photo ever in my life.
alexfjterranova|@DaniRay21 I don't understand why people do this... It disgusts me
alexfjterranova|Be careful when you use these types of social media. Don't underestimate how sick or mean someone can be
alexfjterranova|I don't have a Grindr, Tinder, or anything like that.....
alexfjterranova|Sometimes I just need to be reminded about how to go about everything... Do everything in love
alexfjterranova|Attention world I love @MichaelNorco and I don't care who knows it
alexfjterranova|Can't make the same mistake over again. I know what is best
alexfjterranova|If your snapchat story is over 10 pictures/videos... It's too long. Nobody has time for that
alexfjterranova|Maybe the money and great opportunities will come, but family and friends won't stick around... And by the time was it worth it?
alexfjterranova|If you buy into your own attitude 100% of the time, you'll get no where...
alexfjterranova|I want it, like bad. There's a reason for these 5:30 workouts and two a days
alexfjterranova|Whenever my mom says she'll be inside a store for 10 min, I always believe it... And then 40 min go by...
alexfjterranova|Aw yeah... J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETS!!! @nyjets
alexfjterranova|Brandon Marshall you are the man
alexfjterranova|Respect a champion
alexfjterranova|"""Money can't buy you love cause it's over priced"""
alexfjterranova|@DrDan_11 and you
alexfjterranova|Fast forwarding my snaps is probably one of my favorite things to do now
alexfjterranova|@Coley_xoxd inspiring! Awesome job
alexfjterranova|Most awkward meeting ever

alexfjterranova|Man so disappointed in my @Mets. You guys aren't ready. Nor do you want this bad enough. Terrible coaching, hitting, and defense

alexfjterranova|@Jeff_Lusardi make the Royals give back Murphy's water bottle. We need hits
alexfjterranova|KC killing my Mets... Pathetic... Not World Series worthy when you play like this
alexfjterranova|@jazzysmooth21 game 6 or 7 finisher
alexfjterranova|Also the Mets saw all of the Royals bullpen. We know what they throw
alexfjterranova|Positives... Game 4 Royals need to figure out a starter. Volquez is no Bumgardner and won't have his best on 3 days of rest...
alexfjterranova|Before everyone starts talking smack about my Mets....
alexfjterranova|That's baseball... Can't say anything bad about the Royals... But for my Mets? Smh too many opportunities blown

_lovejazjaz|"I'm a ""my horoscope is right"" kinda girl."
_lovejazjaz|Some of my friends really make me feel like I'm the best mom to Leilani. They literally have no idea how much they impact me 😭
_lovejazjaz|Like those conversations that are so good, when you decide to glance at your phone 2 hours have past &amp; you are like oh shit 😳
_lovejazjaz|Having friends that sit there and talk about goals in life and ways to accomplish that is seriously so great 👏🏽
_lovejazjaz|Who knew the best conversations would happen in the parking lot at 1 am with your coworkers 😩❤️
_lovejazjaz|I just want to go shopping but priorities 🙃
_lovejazjaz|Literally ate too much &amp; now I'm stuck at work &amp; all I want to do is nap 😭😭😭😭😭

_lovejazjaz|Life is beautiful. Why wouldn't I laugh and enjoy it?
_lovejazjaz|I literally laugh at everything.
_lovejazjaz|FUCKING DEAD 😂😭😭😭😭 https://t.co/4w1OyTsq8P
_lovejazjaz|Staying up to clean while everyone's sleeping is so peaceful, until I drop a dish &amp; stand there waiting to see if my daughter woke up 😂🤦🏽‍♀️
_lovejazjaz|And though my heart can take no more I keep on running back to you 🎶
_lovejazjaz|@_supstxr I NEED TO GET A DOG ALREADY

_lovejazjaz|I need a night at the beach, by myself, just my toes in the sand with some music playing...🎶
_lovejazjaz|Thanks Greys Anatomy, for consistently making me cry every Thursday night
_lovejazjaz|Why why why
_lovejazjaz|🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
_lovejazjaz|I'm just tired. I'm so damn tired.
_lovejazjaz|Then there's that one sweet patient who understands and them by themselves flipping your entire day around &amp; making you smile.
_lovejazjaz|This patient complaining about everything to management, trying to get you fired, management up your ass, this patient calling you 1000x
_lovejazjaz|Some days you have 1 patient cussing us all out, this family member up my ass, this patient swinging on everyone, one patient near their end
_lovejazjaz|&amp; I wouldn't trade it for the world. I love my job and I love my family, but man, some days are rough 😞
_lovejazjaz|But I'm a mom, so that's never an option. It's get home, cook, clean up, get the kid ready for bed, then crawl to bed.
_lovejazjaz|But others days I get home I just want to drop in bed, cry, and go to sleep because my body is so tired.
_lovejazjaz|Some days are more good than bad and I come home in a great mood, not exhausted.
_lovejazjaz|Working in a hospital is so physically, mentally, and emotionally draining 😓
