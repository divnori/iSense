ihaveanxiety___|@AkhiMoin thank you
ihaveanxiety___|But no one will ever see it, because I am too afraid to follow people. All the anxiety accounts are not my anxiety
ihaveanxiety___|Even starting this account took so much courage.
ihaveanxiety___|"I tell people about my issues, they say ""go see your counselor"" and they done see that the idea is terrifying"
ihaveanxiety___|I  scared of talking to people.
ihaveanxiety___|Sometimes I am too scared to get up in class just to throw something away because then people might notice me
ihaveanxiety___|I always feel bad when people try and talk to me but I don't know how to talk to people and I think I just seem like a bitch
ihaveanxiety___|Sometimes I am too scared to even talk to my grandparents on the phone
ihaveanxiety___|When you get invited to a party and are too scared to talk to people so you kinda just sit in the corner and occasionally smile
ihaveanxiety___|Hello. I am scared of people.

hollygracexox|One of the hardest things in life is watching the one you love, love someone else
hollygracexox|If you told me you missed me I would be so happy
hollygracexox|I'm scared that your going to move on, find someone new and forgot about me

trvpical|insanity is reality
trvpical|"""when you're sad, listen to happy songs"" listening about other people's happiness won't make me happy"

to feel loved for once"
trvpical|people always say it's selfish if you commit suicide. but i swear, if they felt my pain and suffer everyday. they would have killed themself
trvpical|silently crying because you don't want anyone to judge you is the worst thing ever
trvpical|the mirror is my enemy
trvpical|i want to know what it's like to be loved back
trvpical|forever complaining about my appearance
trvpical|i will destroy myself in anyway possible

trvpical|i have much to live for, yet unaccountably i am sick and sad.
trvpical|ok but the problem with what you're saying is that i don't care
trvpical|i'm still reaching for the right words
trvpical|"new years resolution 2013: i'm gonna try to be happy and good this year

new years resolution 2014: stop making new years resolutions"

trvpical|im tired of feeling like im fucking crazy
trvpical|quote this with your favorite picture of lana del rey
trvpical|no one likes you when you're ugly and fat
trvpical|forever feeling my non existent collarbones
trvpical|i wouldn't choose me either.
trvpical|waiting for you, being angry at you, then loving you. it's a never ending cycle.
trvpical|i don't even know why i try any more
trvpical|i hate it when people try to force me into doing things i really don't want to do
trvpical|i'm alone even when i'm around other people
trvpical|you can be addicted to a certain type of sadness
trvpical|i wish i had never even met you
trvpical|i am a deeply unhappy person
trvpical|"i'm just a

trvpical|i hate it when people complain that they're not good at something when its so obvious that they're amazing at it and i'm just there like oh
trvpical|"you may hate me
but nobody hates me
more than i hate myself"
trvpical|i care about people who don't give a flying fuck about me, do you see the problem now
trvpical|i'm basically a clingy needy piece of shit that just wants to cuddle and to sleep and to watch stupid movies and to make out with you
trvpical|my room is tiny yet i still manage to mess it up
trvpical|my love for you was bulletproof but you're the one who shot me
trvpical|im sorry i fuck up so much
trvpical|i'd be the happiest person in the world if i could have you in my arms
trvpical|"another night

trvpical|"countless flaws
countless imperfections"
trvpical|"easy to love a stranger
hard to love yourself"
trvpical|kinda want to die kinda want to make out
trvpical|what if the monsters in my head are the ones that want me dead instead?
trvpical|i managed to stay clean for 3 months this is great
trvpical|if i disappeared you wouldn't look for me
trvpical|fact: nobody really cares about me
trvpical|i prefer breaking my own heart than getting my heart broken by you
trvpical|tbh i would love a guy with scars with my whole heart
trvpical|i'm never getting better. i'll never get better
trvpical|do you ever think you're special to someone but then you see this person acting the same way with someone else and you just kind of 😄🔫
trvpical|just want to stop existing for a little while
trvpical|i'm sorry http://t.co/DUB1t0RtfV
trvpical|being lonely is one of the shittiest feelings ever
trvpical|i know you probably tell that to every girl but it still makes me feel special
trvpical|spending my only teenage years feeling sad and wanting to die
trvpical|everytime i'm fuckin gettin happy i feel guilty that i don't feel sad and that makes me even more sad and then i'm back to being depressed
trvpical|what happens when you become the main source of the pain
trvpical|sadness consumes every little piece of your soul
trvpical|i'm a massive mistake
trvpical|i don't care about anything anymore
trvpical|some people just can't see how much words can hurt
trvpical|faking smiles
trvpical|"i told you my secrets
and you said you'd never leave me"
trvpical|you know those moods where everything makes you punch a wall
trvpical|i don't feel like i can trust anyone and that's really bad
trvpical|i am my own best friend and my own worst enemy
trvpical|having a proper emotional breakdown
trvpical|i'm so useless i just kind of exist
trvpical|tired of everything
trvpical|i feel like i'm wasting my time on the wrong people
trvpical|overthinking will be the death of me
trvpical|envy the confidence in some people
trvpical|i need to sleep for a couple of years
trvpical|literally can't deal with any more bullshit
trvpical|when will you realise that making fun of someone's insecurities is not funny
trvpical|nothing scares me anymore.
trvpical|i pretend i'm happy for the sake of everyone else but honestly, i am a mess of scars and bruises and depressed incoherent thoughts.
trvpical|come on skinny love just last the year
trvpical|so cold here omg someone cuddle me pls
trvpical|thanks for making me feel worthless.
trvpical|you fit me better than my favourite sweater.
trvpical|i wish my thighs were as small as my self esteem
trvpical|i have accepted the fact that i will never be happy
trvpical|i think about dying all the time
trvpical|suicidal 24/7
trvpical|i can't cope with the thought of you going away
trvpical|christmas list: you
trvpical|everyone forgets about me eventually
trvpical|it's like drowning but you just won't fucking die
trvpical|i just want someone to be proud of me instead of ashamed
trvpical|tbh http://t.co/tTLeouEfij
trvpical|my favourite thing to do is sleep
trvpical|you're never there when i need you
trvpical|why don't you fucking love me like the way i fucking love you
trvpical|constantly sad
trvpical|here in the darkness i find myself
trvpical|literally all i think about is you and killing myself
trvpical|my appearance is so shit
trvpical|"when we have each other 
we have everything"
trvpical|i just want to fucking be with you
trvpical|fact: im ugly
trvpical|very unhappy and very unattractive
trvpical|you are so broken and no one cares enough to notice
trvpical|i destroyed myself
trvpical|"mistakes have been made. 

and i will be blamed."
trvpical|why do all these bad things always happened to me?
trvpical|you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself &amp; sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.
trvpical|"sadness in my head
other emotions are all dead"
trvpical|when i was young.. http://t.co/3enBR1B5Di
trvpical|2014 will just be a new year with the same old crap
trvpical|"care less
love more"
trvpical|all i want is to feel wanted
trvpical|"believing in yourself
won't achieve everything
but it's a big part of
accomplishing what you want"
trvpical|you're tearing me apart
trvpical|falling leaves are like dead bodies that can't stop dancing
trvpical|it's too cold it's making me not want to do anything
trvpical|i can't spend my life caving for you
trvpical|physically ill from the way you breathe
trvpical|push people away before you hurt them

trvpical|sing me to sleep
trvpical|i get attached so easily
trvpical|i'll be okay, dont worry about me
trvpical|can't wait until i stop thinking about you
trvpical|boys are dumb, we dont need them
trvpical|i am such a shit person
trvpical|"your face is like a melody

trvpical|wouldn't mind always having someone to cuddle with whenever
trvpical|i dont even care about myself anymore and thats not good i guess
trvpical|you just dont get it, do you
trvpical|i see humans but no humanity
trvpical|i could fall for you over and over again, no matter how many bruises it might leave on my legs.
trvpical|"everyone please follow my other account @coldsouIs

trvpical|i'm just so tired. not even physically
trvpical|its getting harder to smile everyday
trvpical|"the wasted years
the wasted youth 
the pretty lies
the ugly truth"
trvpical|i deserve someone who gives a shit.
trvpical|emotions are dangerous
trvpical|looking in the mirror makes me want to die lol
trvpical|"promises are meant to be broken
people are meant to grow apart"
trvpical|someone kill me please just do it i hate everything and everyone and the world is a shit place and i'm a shit person and just kill me
trvpical|i will never forgive anyone of you who left
trvpical|life is overrated
trvpical|boy i'm done with you messing with my mind
trvpical|this is not reality
trvpical|someone loves everything you hate about yourself
trvpical|it's weird because a paper cut hurts like fuck but when cutting myself deliberately i feel no pain at all
trvpical|its getting harder everyday.
trvpical|2013 has been the worse year ever.
trvpical|you don’t realize how attached you are to someone until you go without talking to them for a bit
trvpical|i hate being compared to others
trvpical|i wish i could just disappear
trvpical|my parents don't understand that sometimes their criticism actually hurts
trvpical|school would be better if everyone minded their own fucking business
trvpical|"mnsters under my bed?
more like monsters in my head"
trvpical|i can never go to sleep early
trvpical|i fucking hate judgemental people like fuck off
trvpical|people point out my flaws like i dont notice them already
trvpical|i am no ones first choice lol
trvpical|depression feels like you are drowning inside your own mind
trvpical|http://t.co/4s80OWAua8
trvpical|no one hates me more than i hate myself
trvpical|i overthink too much
trvpical|sometimes you just need someone to tell you you're not as terrible as you think you are
trvpical|it makes me sad that all my followers feel like this honestly i just wish i can take all your worries away and replace them with happiness.
trvpical|i wish i could be enough for myself
trvpical|you guys deserve to be alive, you are worth it. always remember that. i love you so much.
trvpical|i am tired of being so sad
trvpical|i'm more broken than you think
trvpical|i get annoyed by people so easily
trvpical|don't you hate it when people constantly keep talking when you don't wanna be bothered
trvpical|i haven't felt alright, for a really long time
trvpical|my heart is so tired
trvpical|my smile, my happiness.. its all fake
trvpical|being sad 24/7 is getting annoying
trvpical|"i just want to sleep for a very long time
maybe forever is enough?"
trvpical|its almost 2014 and we're all still here. i'm proud of you guys, ily.
trvpical|if you didn't mean it, then why would you say it?
trvpical|even if everyone told me no, i'd still love you and wind up getting hurt
trvpical|have you ever met someone who made you feel warm in the coldest weather with their words
trvpical|if you taught me anything it was that love is about taking risks
trvpical|all i want to do is love and be loved
trvpical|i can tell you don't even want to talk to me so i don't know why i try
trvpical|i just want a nice boy with a nice smile and a nice gentle kiss
trvpical|i just want to walk away from my past why is that so hard to do
trvpical|i fucking hate everyone
trvpical|is it in your nature to be an asshole all the time or
trvpical|you're the only person i wish i had never met
trvpical|all i want is happiness
trvpical|my happiness never lasts for long
trvpical|real life has no appeal
trvpical|i'm always the one who loves more and that's my fucking problem
trvpical|did you forget about me or do you just not care anymore because i don't even know right now
trvpical|"""if a writer falls in love with you, you can never die"""
trvpical|i fuck everything up because i don't know what i want and it really makes me sad
trvpical|what happens when you become the main source of the pain?
trvpical|"its a big big world
its easy to get lost in it"
trvpical|"tell me was it worth it? 
we were so perfect"
trvpical|so cute http://t.co/IsU9Vu7KQq
trvpical|i dont like living
trvpical|"some people know how to make me smile.
thats why i love them so much."
trvpical|i dont have anything to live for
trvpical|i'm in one of those 'cuddle up with someone and watch lame movies while i kiss their neck and take off their pants’ moods
trvpical|"i'm not even a second choice lol
i'm never fucking good enough"
trvpical|why am i never good enough?
trvpical|i can't. http://t.co/1byRtOAShj
trvpical|i need somebody to hold me
trvpical|everyone finds someone who is better than me
trvpical|i cant even enjoy one single moment of my life anymore
trvpical|life was never fun
trvpical|i'm just one of those girls, you will forget me in a few months. do not even worry about me, i'm used to all of this, and i feel fantastic.
trvpical|i feel horrible
trvpical|no i'm not fucking fine
trvpical|i got used to all of this.. this sadness, emptiness, and this loneliness.
trvpical|i want to kill myself but i dont want to be forgotten by everyone.
trvpical|things are so different without you
trvpical|"the boys, the girls, they all like carmen
she gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes.
she laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond."
trvpical|it's okay if you have no soul, at least you have mine.
trvpical|i'm so tired, i just want to sleep for a year or two
trvpical|we're all fake, everything about us is fake.
trvpical|i have never had any real friends. everyone is just fake
trvpical|isn't it sad that we kinda get used to this pain?
trvpical|i'm so done with everyone and everything in this fucked up world
trvpical|i'm too stupid to kill myself.
trvpical|everyone leaves but i just can't
trvpical|no one will ever understand how much it hurts
trvpical|"i'm tired of this thing called ""life"""
trvpical|i wish i didn't exist
trvpical|its so hard to stay happy in this world
trvpical|what are your favourite books?
trvpical|lost in my thoughts.
trvpical|"i find it kinda funny, i find it kinda sad.
the dreams in which i'm dying,
are the best i've ever had."
trvpical|i wish i lost weight the way i lose everything else.
trvpical|diet mountain dew, baby new york city.
trvpical|"i will learn to love again,
for now i'm breaking."
trvpical|"i'd say go to hell, 
but i never want to see you again."
trvpical|even when i'm happy i could kill myself.
trvpical|don't get attached.
trvpical|instead of teaching us about how drugs are bad, teach us on how to be happy without them.
trvpical|i'm going to crawl in a ball and never come out bye i hate everything
trvpical|our love is a dangerous game, one that i'm definitely loosing
trvpical|you need a vacation from my mind
trvpical|"so young
so damaged"
trvpical|and what if our lives are just books on their library shelves somewhere, waiting to be read
trvpical|looking at pictures of yourself as a baby and remembering that you still have the same heart beating inside of you is fun
trvpical|imagine reading a book of every conversation where people have spoken about you
trvpical|emotions are a waste of time
trvpical|thank you for being there when no one else was, even though you fucking left too
trvpical|@brokenvibe aw ilym
trvpical|i'm sick of hating myself
trvpical|i wont go to school on friday. i will go to the library, spend my day there and look for some new books, yeah im a badass i know.
trvpical|i haven't left my bed today and i don't feel one bit bad about it
trvpical|the fact that some girls wear extensions and false eyelashes every day astounds me because i cant be bothered to put on pants regularly
trvpical|dark and lonely i need somebody to hold me
trvpical|barely breathing
trvpical|why are boys such assholes
trvpical|pathetic is the new black
trvpical|i can already tell that tomorrows gonna suck.
trvpical|my anxieties have anxieties
trvpical|"i have lost myself again
lost myself and i am nowhere to be found"
trvpical|i sing the body electric baby
trvpical|i feel so alone in a world of 7 billion people
trvpical|@Iostminds thanks bby ♡

trvpical|@the_weird_human aw thank you so much x
trvpical|@ownddlove im from germany
trvpical|@brokenvibe i bet youre beautiful baby, ily
trvpical|@brokenvibe aw thank you
trvpical|@brokenvibe what bby?
trvpical|i like my death pretty as it nears and silent when it's here.
trvpical|why do i even try its all a fucking waste
trvpical|nobody will ever love me
trvpical|please don't give up on me
trvpical|pure stupidity pisses me off
trvpical|i'll stick around until you really scare me away
trvpical|the only thing school taught me is that i wanna die
trvpical|at night my thoughts wander and find you.
trvpical|it's like drowning but you just won't fucking die
trvpical|let me show you how to fucking love
trvpical|i destroyed myself
trvpical|"•looking at my face: oh my god why
•looking at my body: oh my god why
•looking at my life: oh my god why"
trvpical|it's funny how people forget about you in a blink of an eye
trvpical|my suicidal thoughts are back worse than ever
trvpical|"will you still love me
         if i don't wake up tomorrow"
trvpical|i stopped living a long time ago
trvpical|everyday i feel a little more empty inside
trvpical|what makes depression worse is that it is addictive. you become comfortable in being sad.
trvpical|if you can't handle me at my worst then that's too bad dude because that's all there is to me
trvpical|the worst thing is when you see a really good friend start to replace you
trvpical|you know when you can just tell someone doesn't want to talk to you anymore
trvpical|i wish i had a nice personality but i am literally a piece of shit
trvpical|i waste so much time hating myself
trvpical|i dont know what i’m doing with my life but i know i’m doing it wrong
trvpical|i just need someone that can stand me when i’m sad
trvpical|everyone’s just looking for reasons to wake up and get out of bed
trvpical|someone loves everything you hate about yourself
trvpical|i don’t like talking to people about emotional stuff because then they learn things about me and it makes me feel really weak and pathetic
trvpical|why are bad people blessed with good bodies
trvpical|do you ever get in one of those moods where you’re feeling ok like nothing bad has happened but you’re really sad and empty at the same time
trvpical|it's great when you stop being so caught up in someone you used to care a lot for in the past who did nothing but make you unhappy
trvpical|boys with strong jawlines and soft eyes kill me
trvpical|the perks of being fucked up
trvpical|who are your favorite authors?
trvpical|at least in death you can't disappoint the ones you love
trvpical|i feel like others make fun of me all the time
trvpical|you deserve happiness, so i left.
trvpical|too broken to move on
trvpical|you can't treat people like shit and then expect them to love you
trvpical|just let me be happy please
trvpical|"how more can i break
till i shatter?"
trvpical|can i please die before another shitty year even starts
trvpical|all i have is a broken heart and my pathetic life.
trvpical|friends are the family we choose for ourselves, so choose wisely.
trvpical|time does nothing, it just replaces memories.
trvpical|if you're awake at 3am and you're in love or lonely, i don't know which one's worse.
trvpical|"答应我你不会离开我

promise me you'll never leave me"
trvpical|can someone just love me already
trvpical|if it was possible, i would go to the forest right now and kill myself.
trvpical|i wish i could delete what i've done, so i can be happy again and just love life.
trvpical|if you ask how im doing, i would say im doing just fine, i would lie and say that youre not on my mind
trvpical|every night http://t.co/Eede2CvOUo
trvpical|its really easy to fuck everything up
trvpical|"""i want to die"" 
how many times do you repeat that in your head?"
trvpical|this was never meant to happen
trvpical|i hate my body, i hate my face, i hate my hair and my personality and my sense of humour i hate every little thing about myself
trvpical|"""stop being sad"" thanks that advice made me really happy"
trvpical|everything is falling apart
trvpical|i'm so tired of being here.
trvpical|"her feelings she hides
her dreams she can't find
she's losing her mind"
trvpical|my thoughts will destroy me
trvpical|so much for trying hard this year. i'm such a fucking failure lmao.
trvpical|you can run but you can never escape.
trvpical|cute couples make me wanna kill myself
trvpical|the type of girl who'd apologise for staining his shirt when he stabbed her
trvpical|i don't know why i'm still here
trvpical|feeling so damn terrible right now
trvpical|being given up on is the worst thing that could ever happen.
trvpical|i have nothing to live for
trvpical|2014 please be good
trvpical|2013 is almost over. this was the shittiest year of my life.
trvpical|i just want to cut right now
trvpical|my bones are being crushed by the intense sadness flowing through my veins
trvpical|you dont care about a word i say
trvpical|im so lost without you
trvpical|a cool date would be your bed
trvpical|confession: i miss you
trvpical|nothing lasts forever
trvpical|i want to be kissing you instead of missing you
trvpical|mood: http://t.co/JHOjqdKaJj
trvpical|i just want to be happy
trvpical|you bleed just to know you're alive
trvpical|waking up feeling shit is the worst
trvpical|"cut my wrists, slit my throat
i have nothing left, what is hope?"
trvpical|for some reason i just physically can't get to sleep anymore
trvpical|i'm constantly torn between killing myself and killing everyone around me. everything else is just killing time.
trvpical|i honestly just don't feel like im good enough for any of you
trvpical|"scared to get close
and hate being alone"
trvpical|can't fucking deal with this
trvpical|i don't want to live like this
trvpical|don't think i can express more how much i hate my life
trvpical|like im going to end up more lonely than i already am
trvpical|i really wish i was someone's first choice
trvpical|im just watching you being happy, wishing it was me who you were with
trvpical|overthinking killed my happiness
trvpical|nobody cares so i keep it all to myself
trvpical|i can't replace you
trvpical|why can't school just burn i mean it's already hell so
trvpical|she was waiting for sadness to kill her.
trvpical|mood: http://t.co/4i7C0cTXNy
trvpical|almost 39k followers.. well thats kinda sad
trvpical|the pain is with me all the time
trvpical|the loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.
trvpical|don't you dare sit there and tell me that i didn't try. i did.
trvpical|we all have terrible secrets. we keep them hidden like they're not important
trvpical|"''go kill yourself''

yeah, maybe i will"
trvpical|i'm so tired of this
trvpical|everyone forgets me eventually
trvpical|"i am no ones first choice
i am not even an option"
trvpical|i feel so alone
trvpical|"its okay if you let me down
everyone does it anyways"
trvpical|"dear stress,
let's break up"
trvpical|nothing is worse then then pain you caused me
trvpical|you make me feel shit
trvpical|my heart is full of hate and regret
trvpical|http://t.co/gx9gEF44st
trvpical|i ruin everything
trvpical|no point in trying when im just gonna be disappointed again
trvpical|everything is building up and its just too much
trvpical|i hate people so much
trvpical|whats the point though
trvpical|i can't just forget, and move on. it's not that simple.
trvpical|the point is. there's a lot that comes with living, but i'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to be this hard.
trvpical|i'm so exited for the believe movie omg
trvpical|"""she cuts for attention"" oh sure that's why she's doing it with the doors and windows locked instead of in the middle of a room full people"
trvpical|it's killing me inside but i still need to smile, i don't want anyone to notice.
trvpical|"she hided all her sad feelings
she hided it all behind a smile
a smile that everyone believed
a smile that told everyone
she was happy"
trvpical|we ended up as just another creation of society
trvpical|everything i do or say, is wrong.
trvpical|i'm such a failure
trvpical|i'm not what my parents wanted me to be
trvpical|being sad 24/7 is getting really annoying
trvpical|@helptheangel aw thank you x
trvpical|@zhixuannnnn_ thanks baby
trvpical|"- ""why don't you smile anymore?""
- ""because i'm tired of faking a smile"""
trvpical|im so sick of myself
trvpical|black is such a happy colour
trvpical|"do u ever just wake up and realise
   ""holy shit, i'm a fuckin loser"""
trvpical|"- ""are you happy?""
- ""do i look like i am happy?"""
trvpical|fake happiness is still the worst sadness
trvpical|i'm ugly and depressed
trvpical|we're all just lost souls, aren't we?
trvpical|some of us are ready to die
trvpical|i just wanted you to make me forget about my tragic life
trvpical|have been feeling so numb lately
trvpical|"being in love is shit 
everything is basically shit"
trvpical|i'm slowly giving up
trvpical|pain demands to be felt
trvpical|my insecurities are always there

trvpical|people say goodbye in their own special way
trvpical|two years ago it started but one year ago i understood
trvpical|i tried to smile today then i realized theres no point anyway
trvpical|honestly, my life is shit.

trvpical|if anyone hasn't already told you today, youre beautiful. have a nice day, ily.
trvpical|i hate being replaced yet i am never surprised when it happens
trvpical|it really sucks when everything is falling apart and you have no energy to do anything about it
trvpical|i wish you could see how much i'm trying
trvpical|distance means nothing when the person means everything
trvpical|feeling lonely and weak
trvpical|38k what what what

trvpical|types of boys: http://t.co/ygdnYiLxix
trvpical|all you're left with is bundles of broken promises and lies, and constant sighs of disappointment
trvpical|why is being sad turning into a trend
trvpical|i guess things will just never go my way
trvpical|2013 has been the worst year of my life
trvpical|so confused and upset ugh
trvpical|can i move out
trvpical|what am i doing with my life
trvpical|why am i jealous when you're not even mine
trvpical|i'm sad
trvpical|self harm is not tragically beautiful but that doesn't mean the self harmer is not beautiful living a tragic life
trvpical|if it doesn't kill you, it's sure to leave a terrible scar.
trvpical|me everyday: http://t.co/g6iRgm8OnV
trvpical|"everything that kills me 
             makes me feel alive"
trvpical|no i'm not fucking fine
trvpical|"thanks for pretending that you care.
but you can stop now."
trvpical|"it's kinda hard to stay 
positive when you wish 
you were already dead."
trvpical|out of all the people who could rip me to shreds, why on earth did it have to be you?

trvpical|how long till i no longer care about how isolated i feel
trvpical|i wish someone would give up all their plans to see me smile
trvpical|a bad day starts off from the second i look in the mirror
trvpical|school drains all the energy out of me
trvpical|just because it's gone doesn't mean it wasn't once there
trvpical|get along with the voices inside of my head
trvpical|what do you do when you want something but you know you can't have it

trvpical|"six word story:

trvpical|i want to kill myself. now.
trvpical|i cant do this anymore
trvpical|i'm so worthless
trvpical|"i thought i was okay

trvpical|my life is just a collection of poorly made decisions with alternative music playing in the background
trvpical|mosaics are made from broken pieces but they’re still works of art and so are you
trvpical|i always want what i can't have
trvpical|this probably doesn't even make sense

trvpical|i will never be good enough for anyone
trvpical|"ouch

trvpical|my mind is a fucking mess
trvpical|the fear of falling apart
trvpical|you might as well just do whatever you want, you're still gonna get criticized
trvpical|i'm just a waste of space
trvpical|my mind is a bad place
trvpical|what is happiness and where can i buy it
trvpical|sometimes good people make bad decisions. it doesn't mean they are bad people. it means they're human
trvpical|how do people do that thing where they can just talk to anyone and not be nervous at all
trvpical|nothing seems to go right anymore
trvpical|37k thank you guys so much aw
trvpical|seriously just want to kill myself because i'm tired of hurting.
trvpical|"i want somebody to see my flaws and still say ""i love you"""
trvpical|i'm so annoyed with everyone i know. i want to move away and start over.
trvpical|is it wrong being myself?
trvpical|cuddle with me while we watch the snow fall and have cups of hot chocolate
trvpical|i'm trying to escape reality
trvpical|there's a story in her eyes
trvpical|your sadness is my sadness
trvpical|"story of my life: 
i miss you but you don't miss me"
trvpical|pain changes people
trvpical|i'm proud to say that i'm two months clean
trvpical|"you don't know how happy you make me
i'm just afraid that you'll lose interest"
trvpical|we cut and kill flowers because we think they're beautiful, but at the same time we cut and kill ourselves because we think we're not
trvpical|i look for you in everyone i meet
trvpical|it didnt have to be this way
trvpical|i can not wake up in the morning without you on my mind
trvpical|wouldn't life just be a lot better if you just dropped dead
trvpical|i love babies
trvpical|"i wonder if i'm anyones crush

lol nah"
trvpical|im going insane
trvpical|tired and sad of feeling tired and sad
trvpical|fucking voices, get out of my head
trvpical|turn the whole world against me
trvpical|reality is hell
trvpical|and the scars remind me that the past is real
trvpical|"everyday i ask myself
why am i still here?"
trvpical|"i dont want it to get better. 
i just want it to end."
trvpical|save me from myself
trvpical|these voices inside my head are driving me crazy
trvpical|i have never had you in the first place
trvpical|who needs me omg please stop kidding
trvpical|maybe we're just in love with the idea of being loved
trvpical|oh well, perks of being a loser
trvpical|i need a social life
trvpical|everyone is too busy doing their own things that they have forgotten that i exists
trvpical|all my wants has turned to needs
trvpical|i'm sorry for being so irritating
trvpical|my one worded replies means i really hate you and do not ever wish to talk to you
trvpical|i do not want to recover and be normal, i don't see genuine happy days and normal eating and liking my reflection
trvpical|my dad almost made an accident because he wanted to hit me. great.
trvpical|today is not my day
trvpical|when will i get my happy ever after?
trvpical|"depression feels 
like home
happiness is just 
a place
you visit"
trvpical|i dont want to be alive anymore
trvpical|this is not reality
trvpical|"being forgotten by someone 
you can't forget"
trvpical|our souls are connected
trvpical|"i feel like everybody is expecting 
too much from me"
trvpical|don't lose yourself just because you found somebody
trvpical|thought you were different
trvpical|soon comes happiness
trvpical|emotionally drained
trvpical|i let myself down a lot
trvpical|it always seems impossible until it’s done.
trvpical|thanks. you made me feel even shitter about myself.
trvpical|i want to disappear forever
trvpical|did you really think that you could fix me?
trvpical|"""some fear death, others pray for it"""
trvpical|why do feelings exist
trvpical|making a depressed twitter and following loads of other depressed people was the best but worst thing i have done
trvpical|i want cute kisses and cuddles in bed
trvpical|2014 please be good
trvpical|i just want to escape from this life
trvpical|sick to death of feeling depressed
trvpical|i have so much to say but nobody that'll listen
trvpical|i haven't felt alright for a very long time
trvpical|my life just consists of sighs
trvpical|"my life is falling to pieces
do i pick them up and fix them
or burn them"
trvpical|i would never do what you did to me
trvpical|being happy is rare for me
trvpical|"the tears won't stop running down her pale cheeks"""
trvpical|11:11 happiness
trvpical|let me teach you how to love again
trvpical|i find peace in rusted blades and bloody wrists
trvpical|the past is a lonely place
trvpical|if falling for you is crazy then i'm going out of my mind
trvpical|i feel so depressed and empty today, typical.
trvpical|i'm tired of pretending to be okay
trvpical|embarrassed by my own existence
trvpical|don't tell me i deserve happiness when i don't even deserve to live
trvpical|"i don't like to do this thing called ""breathing"""
trvpical|"his name was love
her name was hope

and together
they were happy"
trvpical|emotions are so annoying
trvpical|only know you love her when you let her go
trvpical|feeling super super super suicidal
trvpical|"there's just so much pain
i dont know what to do"
trvpical|"""im fine"""
trvpical|i want to sleep forever
trvpical|i always make stupid decisions
trvpical|im tired of feeling alone
trvpical|im sorry im not what you want
trvpical|"only miss the sun

trvpical|we are all afraid of the unknown
trvpical|get what you give
trvpical|why do we like writing i mean we're literally throwing words on a piece of paper that have the power to destroy us but we like it
trvpical|i need to cut or all of the thoughts will just build up and explode
trvpical|im getting bad again
trvpical|one day you'll realize that you don't need me anymore
trvpical|setting fire to our insides for fun
trvpical|only hate the road when you're missing home
trvpical|to be honest im pretty sure almost all of my friends hate me
trvpical|"""im moving on cause i just want to feel for once that i belong"""
trvpical|we are the kids you're parents warned you about
trvpical|music has great effects on people
trvpical|ugh yes pls http://t.co/8trM0EPG0c
trvpical|"""she's not going to last long here."""
trvpical|drowning deeper into the dark
trvpical|sometimes we feel like the only way for people to love us is to be dead
trvpical|i didn't ask to feel this way
trvpical|it's a twisted addiction
trvpical|"she soon got worse and worse
        with every breath
               with every step
                      she started to fade"

trvpical|kiss me
trvpical|i miss what we had but i'd be stupid to go back to you
trvpical|everything feels different and not in a good way
trvpical|growing apart from someone and looking back on the relationship you had with them is such an empty feeling.
trvpical|i hope you see how much you've hurt me. i'm not forgiving you this time.
trvpical|it seems like everything i see reminds me of you
trvpical|i want to be happy without a boy but boys are addicting, ya know?
trvpical|i hate my mom
trvpical|i want to call you at 3am and have sure you'll answer me.
trvpical|i need someone who can hold me and take care when i fall
trvpical|i'll cry a river and watch series bc i have no expectation of life
trvpical|don’t really feel like walking, talking, eating, thinking or breathing today
trvpical|i was the one worth leaving
trvpical|the only thing standing between me and total happiness is reality
trvpical|feeling super super super suicidal
trvpical|"""live fast, die young"""
trvpical|you are your own kind of beautiful
trvpical|"""the more you act like you don't care the more you push me away"""
trvpical|retweet if you're a part of the #illhueminati so i can follow you
trvpical|i miss the memories more than the person
trvpical|overthinking is dumb and i hate it
trvpical|it's up to you to find beauty in the ugliest days
trvpical|too much of everything can make you sick, even the good could be a curse.
trvpical|people are so ignorant.
trvpical|why did you choose to hurt me?
trvpical|i'm so out of my head but so in my head both at the same time that i'm not sure if i'm imploding or exploding
trvpical|you're so obsessed with finding someone to love you because you can't love yourself
trvpical|all good things must come to an end
trvpical|if falling in love is crazy then call me a psycho
trvpical|each human being is basically good, it's society that's terrible
trvpical|it hurts to feel this way
trvpical|nobody will love me
trvpical|i hate myself more than you could ever hate me
trvpical|im feeling very useless and worthless
trvpical|such a nice weather to stay home with fuzzy socks, comfy sweaters, hot choco and someone (you) to cuddle with
trvpical|thoughts can kill
trvpical|i miss how easy things used to be
trvpical|i am alone with my thoughts
trvpical|you just dont understand what its like
trvpical|someone shoot me in the head please
trvpical|tired of feeling alone
trvpical|hopefully i die and make you happy
trvpical|i dont remember what it feels like to not be tired and sad
trvpical|please dont leave me like everyone else did
trvpical|all my muscles ache from holding myself together
trvpical|i thinking about throwing myself in front of a car
trvpical|"i think everyone is beautiful
excluding myself
of course"
trvpical|i long for that feeling to not feel at all
trvpical|if my life doesnt get any better soon i think im leaving
trvpical|dead generation
trvpical|most things trigger me now its so pathetic
trvpical|this is very good life advice http://t.co/T8puWD11K0
trvpical|in the end im always left alone
trvpical|im so anxious all the time i hate it i hate it i hate it
trvpical|why is smiling so difficult
trvpical|i wouldnt even care if i died right now tbh
trvpical|my own self hatred is killing me
trvpical|please dont ever fall in love with me
trvpical|i breathe in sighs of desperation and loneliness
trvpical|the strangest things make sense to me
trvpical|not many people understand me
trvpical|can we just http://t.co/PoNf9ahcmQ
trvpical|i like black clothes
trvpical|i'm just so sad all the time but it's become my personality now
trvpical|people who hurt the most laugh the loudest
trvpical|there is nothing i would want more right now than to die
trvpical|there is no point trying, there is no pointing living we were born to die so why not speed up the process
trvpical|you make me wanna kill myself
trvpical|why weigh yourself when can set yourself on fire and jump on glass and feel the same way
trvpical|doesn't count as suicide if i'm already dead
trvpical|been crying way too much lately
trvpical|i really like you and that is a very big problem
trvpical|since when did the amount you weigh determine who you are?
trvpical|the later it gets the shittier my tweets are
trvpical|the smallest thing will happen and i will completely shut myself away from everything i hate myself and my overly sensitive stupid mind
trvpical|i wish i could just build a wall around my mind so that nobody could ever find a way into it again
trvpical|i put so much time and effort into work for a future that i'm not even sure i want to live to see
trvpical|i was a fool to think you actually meant the words you said
trvpical|in summary: i am a mess
trvpical|i'm cold and lonely and all i can think about is how every word that spiralled out of your mouth was a lie
trvpical|my mind is no longer cooperating, i  am trying to take part in this morbid melancholy that is life but all i feel think hear see is you
trvpical|the kind of tired that no amount of sleep can fix
trvpical|how can i miss something i never even had?
trvpical|who wants to come and watch skins with me and we can cuddle
trvpical|no one notices me because i'm dead inside
trvpical|one day i'll heal but i'll be covered in scars
trvpical|money is the anthem of success
trvpical|one step forward, 3 steps back
trvpical|i think about you all the time
trvpical|sometimes i just wish it could all go back in time and everything would be the same again
trvpical|someone fall in love with me
trvpical|who needs recovery when i can relapse a thousand times over
trvpical|"when i die please punch anyone who says ""she was so beautiful, i wish i got to know her better"""
trvpical|actually no, im not okay i haven't been okay for months
trvpical|im so tired oh my god kill me
trvpical|i dont want to go to school. no no no
trvpical|"a drop in the ocean
a change in the weather
i was praying that you and me might end up together"
trvpical|never ending self hatred
trvpical|i feel empty without your love
trvpical|they say that love is forever, your forever is all that i need
trvpical|it’s scary how many people think they want to die when really they want to start living
trvpical|sext: let's do drugs together
trvpical|so ready for tropico
trvpical|in the land of gods and monsters i was an angel living in the garden of evil
trvpical|people kinda suck and life kinda sucks and everything kinda sucks
trvpical|in such a bad mood

trvpical|"it's crazy just how lonely you can be

when people are all around you."
trvpical|i love being alone but i hate feeling alone
trvpical|i can't even recognize the person in the mirror, all i see is lies and flaws.
trvpical|i'm so tired of being trapped by my thoughts
trvpical|"""you might as well stop smiling, we can see the pain behind your eyes"""
trvpical|they see your flaws then they leave you for someone better
trvpical|i just want to rest my head on your shoulder whilst you play with my hair and whisper sweet stories into my ears
trvpical|don't make promises to me that you can't keep
trvpical|im not ready for this shit
trvpical|"im torn between
what my head knows
and what my heart wants"
trvpical|not having you is the hardest thing i have ever had to do
trvpical|sleep is the only way i can find sanity
trvpical|in all this sadness i can't help but feel that im going to be lost forever
trvpical|so many tears coming from the girl who gave so many smiles
trvpical|you left me alone with my thoughts, and they fucking tore me apart
trvpical|"it scared me,
realizing just how quickly 
i had lost all perspective 
towards the things i once loved."
trvpical|i don't even have the energy to pretend i have it together today, if i snap then i fucking snap.
trvpical|the worst part of being sad is that you don't know what makes you happy anymore
trvpical|they never see just how hard im fucking fighting
trvpical|suicidal 24/7
trvpical|"misty eyes,
suppressed cries,
razor kissed thighs,
just how much was she keeping inside?"
trvpical|"i don't know if
i'm living in the nightmares
or the reality"
trvpical|i can't stand the thought of having to live life without you
trvpical|it hurts so much to want something you can’t have
trvpical|my parents are lucky that i was too lazy to go through a rebellious phase
trvpical|go to bed sad,and wake up sad.
trvpical|i hated everyone even before it was mainstream
trvpical|you died inside and you don't know why

trvpical|[My Twt Report] via http://t.co/n2Z76FQPEN - http://t.co/M9ESHG0Cj6
trvpical|i need somebody to hold me
trvpical|"does not matter what i wear
i look ugly and fat in everything"
trvpical|"i'm sad
so so sad"
trvpical|i'm lonely
trvpical|"i look ugly without make up on 
and i look ugly with make up on 
do you see my problem"
trvpical|@scrxpting aw youre cute
trvpical|@scrxpting and you are mine. i love you
trvpical|it's unbelievable how nervous i get when someone offers me food or says its time to eat
trvpical|i need to get away from home for a while
trvpical|the only thing I'm successful at is being an insecure worthless whale
trvpical|"- ""it'll get better in the end""
- ""yeah, because it's not fucking happening to you"""
trvpical|"there is a part in everyday
where i lie to myself 
and say that it's okay"
trvpical|"what's it like to

not care about your weight
not care about calories 
not care about how your hair looks

what's it like 
to love yourself?"
trvpical|it's hard to smile or talk or laugh when you want to kill yourself
trvpical|"sometimes i look at my old faded scars
and wonder 
why the hell didn't i go deeper?"
trvpical|they never see just how hard im fucking fighting
trvpical|i will always be insecure about my body
trvpical|"it scared me,
realizing just how quickly 
i had lost all perspective 
towards the things i once loved."
trvpical|"i'm afraid my darling,
that the light at the end of the tunnel
is simply the headlights 
of the oncoming train."
trvpical|no i don't want to go to school no no no
trvpical|you left me alone with my thoughts, and they fucking tore me apart
trvpical|funny how a shiny little smile can cover a dull aching heart
trvpical|i push everyone away just to feel safe
trvpical|"that's the thing about pain
it demands to be felt."
trvpical|lonely people are always up in the middle of the night, remembering everyone who left
trvpical|sleep is the only way i can find sanity
trvpical|"sooner or later 
you'll give up on me

everyone does eventually"
trvpical|i feel fat all the time and no matter what people say all i can do is just feel it
trvpical|they see your flaws then they leave you for someone better
trvpical|i'm so tired of being trapped by my thoughts
trvpical|"nobody sees your successes,
they only see your mistakes.
they don't give a shit about anything but seeing you fail."
trvpical|i don't care if it kills me, i just need to take away this fucking pain
trvpical|i am addicted to something. it's not simply drugs or alcohol. it's something with no cure. i'm addicted to sadness.
trvpical|being sad is exhausting
trvpical|everyday is the same bullshit with more sadness, more stress.
trvpical|the worst thought that always haunts me is knowing that nothing will ever be the same.
trvpical|"i don't even know how to be happy anymore, even if i tried. 

sadness always seems to win"
trvpical|i just want to be okay today.
trvpical|"sometimes you start to become addicted to the constant madness. 

you fall in love with the sadness."
trvpical|i'm so tired of pretending everything is normal and that i'm not completely broken inside.
trvpical|my biggest fear is that eventually you'll see me the way i see myself.
trvpical|i'd rather be skinny with an ugly face than fat with a pretty face
trvpical|oh, what a joy i didn't wake up dead.
trvpical|someone draw circles on my back oh my god
trvpical|can i just sleep for a few days or years i dont really care
trvpical|"so many things you could say and you just said ""bye"""
trvpical|"why do you act like you care?
we both know that you dont give a shit about me."
trvpical|i can't fall asleep but i bet it would be nicer to fall asleep next to you. in your arms and feeling your heartbeat.
trvpical|@scrxpting i love you
trvpical|@scrxpting mine?
trvpical|hold me in your arms
trvpical|@sxbliminal just wanted to make sure you know who i meant
trvpical|@sxbliminal and you know that i meant justin
trvpical|can bob the builder fix my crumbling self esteem
trvpical|i really miss my guy best friend
trvpical|can i just sleep forever
trvpical|you make me so happy and sad
trvpical|i really want to move away from this shit hole
trvpical|sometimes the more i try to smile, the more i feel like crying
trvpical|im addicted to the way i feel when i think of you
trvpical|"""@scrxpting: i just want you to know how much you mean to me"" youre my everything. i love you"
trvpical|i care about everyone but just not about myself.
trvpical|it's so sad that people see you smiling and they automatically think you're okay.
trvpical|god my life is one big mess.
trvpical|don't act like you care
trvpical|i'm just another whatever
trvpical|"i'm alive
but my soul is dead"
trvpical|covering the ugly truth with the pretty lies
trvpical|i hate myself i hate everyone i hate myself i hate everyone i hate myself i hate everyone i hate myself i hate everyone i hate myself
trvpical|don't leave me while i bleed
trvpical|"some hearts are meant to be dead
some souls are meant to be broken"
trvpical|who am i kidding? i really am a failure
trvpical|"i'm living dead
only alive,
when i pretend"
trvpical|what am i even doing here?
trvpical|this empty feeling in my heart..
trvpical|@scrxpting i love you
trvpical|only know you love her when you let her go
trvpical|i want to sleep but i can't leave my phone
trvpical|i feel like the past 9 months of my life have been wasted
trvpical|i really need to learn to not get attached to people i've moved on from once before
trvpical|you mean the world and more to me.
trvpical|and sometimes, things build up and up and up until you can't hold it anymore. and you break. and thats okay. thats human.
trvpical|the less you care the less you'll get hurt
trvpical|i get upset way too easily
trvpical|my head hurts so bad from all this thinking
trvpical|i didn't ask to feel this way
trvpical|"she soon got worse and worse
        with every breath
               with every step
                      she started to fade"
trvpical|you feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
trvpical|at least in death you can't disappoint the ones you love
trvpical|i knew i shouldn't get so attached.
trvpical|"dark and lonely, 
i need someone to hold me"
trvpical|don't get attached to me i will let you down and you will hate me
trvpical|can i put my life into hibernate mode
trvpical|it's hard to forget someone,who gave you so much to remember
trvpical|"""good morning"" there's nothing good about mornings go away"
trvpical|getting out of bed is such a struggle on a morning
trvpical|my beds too warm i don't want to leave
trvpical|i'm cold and i need cuddles
trvpical|life looks like it would be easier if i were an attractive person
trvpical|i feel so drained this morning
trvpical|mood has just gone from really happy to really sad in the space of about three minutes
trvpical|i feel like shit and i just want to sleep
trvpical|call me princess
trvpical|@scrxpting aw ily too babe
trvpical|the sound of the rain is the best sound ever
trvpical|i want you to hold me
trvpical|at this time of night i just get lonely
trvpical|someone cuddle me and play with my hair
trvpical|falling asleep sad and waking up sad is really disgusting tbh

trvpical|i wish i could be enough for myself
trvpical|come cuddle with me on the couch
trvpical|if i want a conversation with anyone these days its me having to make the effort
trvpical|i want to cry at the thought of me staying in bed wasting my life away and not being able to do anything about it
trvpical|i can't pick myself up anymore
trvpical|is disappointing people a talent because i seem to be really good at it
trvpical|time really flys when you do nothing all weekend
trvpical|@scrxpting no youre not..

and tell yourself what you know now. http://t.co/CnXUV4QKYs"
trvpical|"no one gets you, the plastered on fake smile.
the real one has been gone now for quite a while."
trvpical|sometimes it's hard, when the battle you're fighting is against yourself.
trvpical|it's a never ending war with myself
trvpical|i'll never be that perfect daugther my parents want me to be. god, i must be such a disappointment.
trvpical|sometimes i wonder what 8-year-old-me would say if she saw the person she has become today
trvpical|i wish i could cry at someone's shoulder..
trvpical|"cut your wrists 
    to feel alive
skip meals 
    to feel pretty
stay up all night 
    to feel the dark 
          but do you feel at all?"
trvpical|waking up next to you would be great tbh
trvpical|i dont even get along with myself, how can i expect anyone else to?
trvpical|i am freezing someone please cuddle me or set me on fire either is fine
trvpical|i'm trying not to think about how much easier it would be to give up
trvpical|just want someone to stay in bed all day with me
trvpical|"""@scrxpting: i can't fall asleep knowing you're not here😥❤️❤️❤️"" ugh baby, same here:(♥"
trvpical|falling asleep next to you would be so much better

trvpical|@scrxpting aw babe. ily

trvpical|i often imagine how people would react to my death
trvpical|physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted
trvpical|i'm sorry for being such a disappointing daughter
trvpical|"countless flaws
countless imperfections"
trvpical|can my boyfriend please be a hue? so he'll write beautiful poems and i could read them.

trvpical|if i disappeared you wouldn't look for me
trvpical|i think about you more than i should
trvpical|what if the monsters in my head are the ones that want me dead instead?
trvpical|neck kissing is honestly the hottest, most seductive thing anybody could ever do to me
trvpical|kinda want to die kinda want to make out
trvpical|do you ever think you're special to someone but then you see this person acting the same way with someone else and you just kind of 😄🔫
trvpical|isn't it ironic that hearts are heaviest when empty?
trvpical|i prefer breaking my own heart than getting my heart broken by you
trvpical|just want to stop existing for a little while
trvpical|a cool date would be spending the day with you here: http://t.co/ykCovz6P2L

trvpical|why am i still here
trvpical|guys tell me who your favourite authors are.
trvpical|guys what are your favourite books?
trvpical|we spend our entires lives remembering the past and we wonder where the time has gone
trvpical|why did the ugly life choose me
trvpical|is “no” an emotion because i feel it
trvpical|i am the most stressed out laziest person ever i don’t even know how i do it
trvpical|have you ever looked at yourself and been like nope
trvpical|"parents: why don't you come socialize with the family?

trvpical|if they knew http://t.co/SawL4IQkba
trvpical|no one. http://t.co/s0LFApeqm7
trvpical|you.. http://t.co/LOvV0DuPDC

trvpical|you fit me better than my favourite sweater
trvpical|you'll never know how much you mean to me
trvpical|"the morning after was a scene
it seems like
the night before was nothing more
than a bad dream"
trvpical|my school is full of hypocrites and assholes
trvpical|"death sits in the seat next to me.
we make a lovely couple."
trvpical|pretending to be polite is so exhausting
trvpical|isn't it scary to be ready to die at such a young age?
trvpical|i feel like people laugh and make jokes about me all the time
trvpical|boys dont come after you when you walk away, it's not a fairytale.
trvpical|i can't drown my demons, they know how to swim.
trvpical|i'm stuck in this nightmare
trvpical|"the human world..

it's a mess."
trvpical|time heals nothing it only actually replaces memories
trvpical|i miss how easy things used to be
trvpical|i am alone with my thoughts
trvpical|you just dont understand what its like
trvpical|i wish you knew
trvpical|someone shoot me in the head please
trvpical|hopefully i die and make you happy
trvpical|tired of feeling alone
trvpical|have you ever http://t.co/uh4U2CYHCJ
trvpical|"""my heart is still the same"""
trvpical|i lost followers because i tweeted a picture of justin bieber. oh ok
trvpical|please http://t.co/lTpBESH7P6
trvpical|you crave what you can't have
trvpical|"i find it kinda funny, i find it kinda sad.
the dreams in which i'm dying are the best i've ever had."
trvpical|i'm not afraid to die
trvpical|i don't understand how some people find it amusing to hurt someone, just why it's unnecessary
trvpical|"you're just like the stars,
      and the sun,
             and the moon.
i could watch you all day, everyday"
trvpical|this is what i'm afraid of http://t.co/SohTjMDbnx
trvpical|my biggest fear is losing you
trvpical|wondering if you think about me as much as i think about you
trvpical|where were you when everything was falling apart
trvpical|i wanna live life from a new perspective
trvpical|apologising in advance for being a sad fucked up loser
trvpical|sad lonely and constantly miserable
trvpical|addicted to a certain kind of sadness
trvpical|i should do my homework but nah
trvpical|is it just me who always sits in one particular spot for hours on their bed just on their phone doing nothing
trvpical|would give anything to go back to the days when i wasn't constantly lonely and miserable
trvpical|sleeping is my favourite hobby
trvpical|i'm so alone that it only feels right to make decisions that endanger my life
trvpical|i'll be dead before the end of the year
trvpical|i'm a massive mistake
trvpical|literally all i do is disappoint people and myself
trvpical|it feels like tonights the night
trvpical|i've completely lost myself
trvpical|i just want to sleep and never wake up
trvpical|i will love you til the end of time
trvpical|what if im never good enough for anyone?
trvpical|i dont want to feel this lonely anymore
trvpical|"and it feels like
a hole in my chest
where my heart should be"
trvpical|"i'll be okay 
                                   i'll be okay 
         i'll be okay 

                        i'll be okay 
  i'll be okay"
trvpical|i couldn't ask for anything more than your love
trvpical|i miss myself in a way
trvpical|"i’ll never be fully comfortable
until i am holding your heart,
while you’re holding my hand"
trvpical|i just want to nap til i'm dead
trvpical|"if i was my heart 
i'd rather be restless
the second i stop 
the sleep catches up
&amp; i'm breathless"
trvpical|your arms are the only place i feel like i could get a decent night's sleep.
trvpical|i think about reading your mind but i'd be disappointed because i know im not there
trvpical|i seriously wonder what its like to be beautiful, and have boys drool over you.
trvpical|no boy has ever been interested in me lol
trvpical|i need to sleep
trvpical|she was too focused on trying to make everyone around her happy that she couldn't find happiness for herself
trvpical|what the fuck is wrong with me
trvpical|i fuck up everything
trvpical|maybe we should jump off bridges and see who falls faster and who sinks deeper into the water
trvpical|since when did the amount you weigh determine who you are?
trvpical|the smallest thing will happen and i will completely shut myself away from everything i hate myself and my overly sensitive stupid mind
trvpical|never letting myself fall for someone ever again in my life
trvpical|it's terrifying knowing how quickly everything can change
trvpical|can you pretend im not ugly and annoying and fall in love with me
trvpical|basically http://t.co/I1wmln0fL2
trvpical|"""you're looking happy"" http://t.co/kC0bYpUm4h"
trvpical|i'm gonna die alone
trvpical|if your trunk looks like this, feel free to kidnap me http://t.co/eiQIzoE7mu
trvpical|i need to stop having high expectations
trvpical|im trying so hard to forget about you
trvpical|"the one person that can save you

is yourself"
trvpical|i don't belong here
trvpical|basically http://t.co/EhB9vreJTF
trvpical|24/7 anxiety party
trvpical|all i've gained from 2013 is weight
trvpical|me: *accidently ruins everything*
trvpical|my life upsets me so much
trvpical|i'm embarrassing and boring and ugly and i'm sorry
trvpical|did you leave because you realized how messed up i was?
trvpical|i'm done with you messing with my mind
trvpical|if you didn't mean it, than why would you say it?
trvpical|can i please give my life away to someone who really deserves to live
trvpical|too broken to move on
trvpical|i was praying that you and me might end up together
trvpical|"it's like wishing for rain 
as i stand in the desert"
trvpical|there comes a point where you just give up. give up on yourself, on friends, on love, on life, on everything.
trvpical|"rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll realize 
that all of this was just a dream"
trvpical|"do you sometimes think about your future?
i don't, because i don't have a future. i see myself dead."
trvpical|@fairyfIoss happy birthday babe. smile for me and have a nice day. i love you♥
trvpical|i still think about my past and wonder what i have done. maybe i deserve all of this. maybe it's just another lesson. or maybe it's the end.
trvpical|crying myself to sleep every night shows how weak and stupid i am
trvpical|"i really miss this ""happy"" feeling"
trvpical|i can't even enjoy one single moment of my life anymore
trvpical|"the monsters should be under my bed
not inside my head."
trvpical|i don't have any control over my life anymore
trvpical|i'm okay, i just feel tired 24/7
trvpical|"look at me when i'm talking to you.
you're looking at me but i'm looking through you."
trvpical|i'm just living a lie and it's getting worse
trvpical|go away negative thoughts
trvpical|i get triggered so easily it's ridiculous
trvpical|school sucks today sucks life sucks feelings suck why wasn't i born as a flower.
trvpical|the pain is everywhere.
trvpical|next week. yes, next week i will try to kill myself, i dont care anymore.
trvpical|"kill me
shoot me
i want to die"
trvpical|it's sad how much we forgive just because we don't want to lose someone, even if they don't deserve forgiveness
trvpical|kinda sorta wish i didn't exist right now
trvpical|i'd really like to be my old self again
trvpical|some people haunt without being dead
trvpical|a cool date would be http://t.co/d8exa692rM
trvpical|sometimes you have to let people walk away and believe it's for the best
trvpical|i am completely 100% convinced that there is a rock in your chest where your heart should lie
trvpical|a little empty but other than that i'm doing okay
trvpical|*pulls knife out of back* everything makes sense now
trvpical|"home (n.)
in your arms"
trvpical|my life upsets me so much
trvpical|not all those who smile are happy
trvpical|weird enough, a broken heart does physically hurt, it feels heavy, like as if someone is sitting in your chest.
trvpical|if my family knew all my secrets i would die
trvpical|"i'm living a nightmare
that keeps playing over again"
trvpical|"you used to be so innocent and sweet
and now you're broken and bruised"
trvpical|i never get any sleep
trvpical|i hate my dad
trvpical|it is what it is
trvpical|"cover up
those sunken eyes
put on a smile
and tell some lies"
trvpical|anxiety
trvpical|if only they knew how ugly i always feel around everyone
trvpical|"i constantly feel like a failure
no matter what i do"
trvpical|i feel like crying
trvpical|i don't feel anything i guess
trvpical|i need a break from reality
trvpical|"you don't understand how it feels
to think everyone is watching you
to think everyone is judging you
to think that you'll always mess up"
trvpical|only miss the sun when it starts to snow
trvpical|tired of being sad
trvpical|"she fades away
along with her scars
and along with her memories"
trvpical|she hurts a lot more than you think
trvpical|"don't fucking tell me you understand
because you don't
you don't know how hard it is
to feel lonely and unwanted"
trvpical|"sometimes the ones you look up to
are just as broken as you are"
trvpical|if you are struggling with anything right now, just know that im here for you and i will do anything in my power to make you smile again.
trvpical|music has great effects on people
trvpical|i'm not ok and i probably never will be
trvpical|no im not fucking ok
trvpical|only hate the road when you're missing home
trvpical|to be honest im pretty sure almost all of my friends hate me
trvpical|where is my real smile and where can i buy it
trvpical|30.000 followers omg thank you so much, ily
trvpical|i still love you but you don't love me and i don't know what i am going to do
trvpical|i tried to fight for you but it was never enough for you to realise how much i needed you
trvpical|we can blame it on a lot of things or we can just admit that we are shit people
trvpical|you completely changed who you were
trvpical|there is so much pressure forced on to teenagers and our parents just don't understand
trvpical|my mom needs to fuck off
trvpical|i don't think my own mother is supposed to make me contemplate suicide but she does a very good job at it
trvpical|if i reply to your texts in 1.48 milliseconds then i expect you to do the same
trvpical|i'm a loner
trvpical|i really need a boyfriend
trvpical|http://t.co/Yx8M5mb38h
trvpical|a cute date would be http://t.co/PiYNhvlBUp
trvpical|we rely on dreams to keep us going in life and it's sad when they're the things that tear us down
trvpical|i think about kissing you a lot
trvpical|if falling in love is crazy then call me a psycho
trvpical|loving you was the last thing that i felt really good at
trvpical|i've got to stop feeling anything at all
trvpical|it kinda sucks that i don't know why i'm even here
trvpical|"don't waste the words ""i love you"" on someone who wouldn't say them back"
trvpical|when i feel like this i swear to god i feel my heart heating up and i can feel all the blood leaving my heart idk its fucking weird
trvpical|"but it's been ""one of those sad days"" for the past several years"
trvpical|cuddles would be perfect right now ok
trvpical|i'm not going to tell you i'm okay because i'm not
trvpical|@DepressionExist achso okay :)
trvpical|@DepressionExist aw schön. die sprache ist eigentlich ziemlich schwer

trvpical|if i follow you, i really love your account. congrats
trvpical|depression ends when it ends you
trvpical|"stained glass eyes 
and colorful tears"
trvpical|im somewhere between a hopeless dreamer and a sociopath
trvpical|i could spend hours with you laying in the dark in complete silence listening to nothing but our hearts beating as one
trvpical|hate it when people are always fishing for compliments
trvpical|i want nothing more http://t.co/hNzTPTbuoj
trvpical|someday someone will love everything you hate about yourself and maybe they already do
trvpical|so close to 30.000 followers omg
trvpical|"kill me 
kill me 
kill me 
kill me"
trvpical|"ugly ugly ugly ugly
that's what i am."
trvpical|i'm a useless piece of shit
trvpical|@nxthingspecial aw ily
trvpical|it gets harder everyday
trvpical|i will always hate myself
trvpical|i have no idea how i'm going to do this on my own
trvpical|my existence is so pointless
trvpical|constantly feeling like shit
trvpical|i hate how one minute i'm okay then the next minute i'm ready to throw myself in front of a car
trvpical|just :) because :) you're :) attractive :) it :) doesn't :) give :) you :) the :) right :) to :) be :) an :) asshole :) :) :) :) :)
trvpical|i don't wanna be lost like this anymore
trvpical|forever sad and lonely
trvpical|your words are hard to hear with a mind full of loud voices
trvpical|i feel so horribly lost and unimportant
trvpical|who the hell even cares whether i exist or not
trvpical|i barely talk to anyone anymore
trvpical|we live alone, we die alone, everything else is an illusion
trvpical|i want to run away from everything
trvpical|it seems like pain and regret are your best friends, cause everything you do leads to them.
trvpical|its impossible to get enough sleep why
trvpical|can today end already
trvpical|i deserve all of this
trvpical|the worst fucking part is that after you've done all of this to me, completely fucking ruined me: i still think you're a good person
trvpical|fat faf fat fat fat fat fat fat fat
trvpical|the only time you fuckin talk to me is when you have nobody else
trvpical|all i want is someone who cares about me and likes to snuggle
trvpical|what the inside of my head looks like: http://t.co/G7VCPbWUEl
trvpical|seriously mean so little to everyone, my existence is useless
trvpical|"i fall too quickly,
i trust too soon,
and i always regret it
because nobody stays
and nobody cares"
trvpical|i wish i was good enough for you
trvpical|i just feel so replaceable
trvpical|i wanna go to bed for 10 years
trvpical|"im never good enough
no matter what i say
or do"
trvpical|constantly worrying about pointless stuff
trvpical|we don’t even ask for happiness, just a little less pain
trvpical|"i don't want to lose you
like i lose everyone else"
trvpical|i hate having responsibilites and i hate myself and i hate life
trvpical|relationship status: crying
trvpical|"hypophrenia: 
a feeling of sadness, seemingly without a cause"
trvpical|i'm too broken to be fixed
trvpical|i'm fucking hopeless and i hate myself
trvpical|do you know what it's like to wake up everyday wishing you hadn't?
trvpical|being a piece of shit is exhausting
trvpical|"i'm 30 days self harm free 
can you guys kiss me pls"
trvpical|"アム私その簡単へ忘れる？

am i that easy to forget?"
trvpical|my self esteem is non existence
trvpical|i don't know how i feel anymore
trvpical|i just want to overdose and be done with it i can't take this anymore
trvpical|you'll end up forgetting me anyway
trvpical|everything about myself is horrible
trvpical|tired of feeling like shit 24/7
trvpical|"lost       forgotten
         sad 
empty        numb"
trvpical|can i delete my face pls
trvpical|thank you for leaving me when i needed you the most
trvpical|pretending to be happy is the hardest
trvpical|"the happiness
              never lasts
 and the sadness 
                      never leaves"
trvpical|stop saying you care when you don't
trvpical|"i don't want to do anything anymore
everything makes me sad"
trvpical|i'd rather not wake up
trvpical|"i need to cry
and maybe die too"
trvpical|fact: everyone leaves
trvpical|and i miss you more than anything
trvpical|"不幸
unhappy"
trvpical|someone come and hold me because i feel like i'm falling apart
trvpical|is being ugly an emotion
trvpical|we all feel lost sometimes, don't we?
trvpical|i can't pick myself up anymore
trvpical|i get progressively uglier throughout the day oh my god
trvpical|i overthink and make myself sad idk
trvpical|i wish i was dead most of the time
trvpical|i want you to miss me
trvpical|i fell apart a long time ago and no one could ever put me back together
trvpical|being ugly is starting to annoy the fuck out of me
trvpical|i don't even understand my own feelings
trvpical|let's get drunk and make out
trvpical|my insecurities could eat me alive
trvpical|but all i ever wanted was for you to stay
trvpical|a promise doesn't mean a thing anymore
trvpical|"and i want you
                            
                              only you"
trvpical|"i want to sleep
   f o r e v e r"
trvpical|i feel a huge breakdown coming up
trvpical|wanna make out for some hours or something
trvpical|i'm sorry that nothing i do is ever right
trvpical|"story of my life: 
i miss you but you don't miss me"
trvpical|"not a thousand tears will make you come back

i have tried"
trvpical|i'm just a loser documenting my losses
trvpical|time heals nothing it only actually replaces memories
trvpical|someone come and hold me because i feel like i'm falling apart
trvpical|"things i want:
you
you
you
you
and you"
trvpical|haha if you're bored you could kiss me idk just saying
trvpical|i'm sad and i want you
trvpical|i really want to make out with you and take cute pictures and make out with you
trvpical|"i want to be close with you 

                         but you're far away"
trvpical|someone pls cuddle with me and play with my hair until i fall asleep
trvpical|we could lie in our underwear and cuddle all day
trvpical|i don't think anybody realizes how alone i am
trvpical|imagine waking up with everything finally being ok
trvpical|"saying you're happy 
isn't the same 
as being happy"
trvpical|don't know what's worst feeling sad or nothing at all
trvpical|"cover my body with your thoughts
suffocate me with your love"
trvpical|life http://t.co/yaIOSUWTUh
trvpical|i'm sad and i want you
trvpical|and when i think of you i don't feel so alone
trvpical|you took a part of me with you when you left
trvpical|what is it like to be happy i can't remember
trvpical|"i feel so sad
the kind of sad that makes you just sit there staring at a wall with a beating pain in your chest"
trvpical|when depression hits you like a bitch
trvpical|"fat is now a feeling.

""how are you feeling?""

""i'm feeling fat"""
trvpical|"i find it kinda funny, i find it kinda sad,
the dreams in which i'm dying are the best i've ever had."
trvpical|i'm losing my fucking mind.
trvpical|everything just keeps getting worse
trvpical|i'm a lot more messed up than you think
trvpical|should probably stop worrying so much about people who don't give a fuck about me
trvpical|how do i save myself from myself
trvpical|imagine being skinny and looking good in anything
trvpical|i hate pretending to be happy because i'm fucking not
trvpical|i'm ridiculously insecure
trvpical|"nobody misses you 
           only when you're dead"
trvpical|someone cuddle me pls
trvpical|i'm so tired of fighting because nothing ever gets better
trvpical|let's do this with each other http://t.co/HXchIjUDUS
trvpical|reality is depressing
trvpical|i kinda wish some people looked like their personalities.
trvpical|note to self: stop trying when he doesn't even care that you exist
trvpical|i like sleeping http://t.co/XmBvyzgAnc
trvpical|"- ""why do we fall?"" 
- ""so we can learn to pick ourselves up"""
trvpical|you're dreams cant save you from the nightmare you constantly live in
trvpical|i hate being on my period like honestly whats the point
trvpical|im gonna stay right here, watch you disappear
trvpical|im losing my mind
trvpical|lifes too short to even care at all
trvpical|a cute date would be http://t.co/yPkzzDvBUc
trvpical|some people are so disgusting like wow congrats on making me hate humanity
trvpical|if everyone can have you then i don't want you anymore
trvpical|a cool date would be http://t.co/C9gNznzAVg
trvpical|i gained almost 400 followers while i was sleeping ha, nice
trvpical|i like anything that's bad for me.
trvpical|it's funny how people forget about you in a blink of an eye
trvpical|i always get treated like shit in the end
trvpical|i'm worried about myself because i don't really try anymore
trvpical|thanks for every message on kik. thanks for caring. i love you guys, you make me feel better.
trvpical|where am i even going with my life lol
trvpical|it's weird how one person can come into your life and make you happy and within seconds they can take it away and it's just like oh
trvpical|do you ever just randomly get upset and sad
trvpical|"you'll leave me
   
                    just like everyone else"
trvpical|just hug me and tell me everything's going to be okay
trvpical|i haven't been okay in a long time and i'm not going to try to be anymore
trvpical|i hate how you can replace me so easily
trvpical|who wants to give up on society and go live in a treehouse with me
trvpical|i'm there for everyone but no ones there for me
trvpical|why do i always feel like i am fucking everything up
trvpical|in pain but still smiling
trvpical|being insecure sucks a shit load
trvpical|no one cares so i keep it all to myself
trvpical|mood: i want to throw myself in front of the next bus
trvpical|i'm a sad teen with a happy face
trvpical|"my only friends 
are the demons in my head"
trvpical|i need http://t.co/9BvTNTgqTP
trvpical|i have nothing left to say to anybody anymore
trvpical|there's no use in existing any longer
trvpical|you know what you do to me
trvpical|"and after years of waiting

                                   nothing came"
trvpical|i miss you so fucking much
trvpical|theres so many things that i could say but im sure it would come out all wrong
trvpical|i hope you haven't forgotten about me. it's impossible for me to forget you.
trvpical|i want to feel the warmth of your skin against mine
trvpical|"don't get too close
   it's dark inside"
trvpical|now would be a nice time to just vanish into thin air

No, you don't understand.."

Inside, I am breaking down into a million pieces"

iamsorry104|"Life is something I no longer care,
Death is something I no longer fear."

Another tear.
Another remainder,
that I am not good enough."

Having to pretend it doesn't hurt at all."

Unluckylonerguy|Why are most people such proud assholes? Can they just take some time to sit down and think about what they have done to their victims?
Unluckylonerguy|Why are attractive people so mean and rude? That explains why I'm always single.
Unluckylonerguy|I was almost killed by a long panic attack today. Man, fuck that.
Unluckylonerguy|It doesn't make sense when my parents call me ugly. I don't choose to look like whoever I want to be, I got the genes from both of them.
Unluckylonerguy|Expect the unexpected events. That's all I can say.
Unluckylonerguy|"Congratulations to my lame, annoying uncle for making it to my ""I hate you, you suck"" list."
Unluckylonerguy|Exactly. https://t.co/KaISxrzV55
Unluckylonerguy|I swear that people are on my fucking nerves.
Unluckylonerguy|I felt like I was born to the wrong set of parents.
Unluckylonerguy|"I freaking hate rude and stingy customers. I'm just like ""go to another planet where quarreling people live and fight every second""."
Unluckylonerguy|Having a crush/ sexual friend breaking my heart is the worst feeling ever. I totally regret meeting this person.
Unluckylonerguy|Who else here hates Donald Trump!
Unluckylonerguy|Who else here are enemies with their parents/ families? I am!
Unluckylonerguy|I suck at making good choices.
Unluckylonerguy|I'm so fed up with having many bad luck moments today.
Unluckylonerguy|Bad things need to stop happening to good people, honestly.
Unluckylonerguy|Why do my parents hate me so much?
Unluckylonerguy|My parents are kicking me out of the house. Please pray that I take really great care of myself! I know I can do this!
Unluckylonerguy|Working full-time is such a benefit when you have no friends to hangout later. All the money goes to me and for charity! 💰
Unluckylonerguy|I feel like it's so unnecessary for me to be depressed after spending money on food. 😤
Unluckylonerguy|It's so hard when you want to quit your job bc of your mean managers but, you need to stay and make money so bad. 👿
Unluckylonerguy|Stay positive! Depression is only temporary and there are plenty of other times that is worth being happy! 👏
Unluckylonerguy|Listen up, loves! Don't hurt or kill yourself, ok? Let me tell you. The strongest victims stay and survive without harming themselves.
Unluckylonerguy|I wish that having severe depression can be eligible to earn unemployment benefits. Right?
Unluckylonerguy|I'm not a violent person but, I always have the urge to punch my managers and annoying co-worker in the face. They all suck.
Unluckylonerguy|I hate being the biggest burden at my workplace especially when you're 100000xs better than anyone else there.
Unluckylonerguy|I want someone to kiss me.
Unluckylonerguy|Haven't done my homework bc of deep depression and anxiety.
Unluckylonerguy|We should create an organization for people who suffer unemployment and always felt rejected by many employers.
Unluckylonerguy|I'm glad that no one accepts me. It helps me realize that I'm on my own and I can become aware of how independent and strong I am.
Unluckylonerguy|I want to live in a room with a bunch of money, food, a TV, my phone, Wifi, and just myself. I FUCKING HATE THIS WORLD!
Unluckylonerguy|"Have you ever just look at yourself in the mirror for a long time and ask ""What kind of human being am I?"" or ""Why am I here?""?"
Unluckylonerguy|I know that Heaven is a perfect place but, how come reality has to be infinitive times worse than up there?
Unluckylonerguy|I hate reality, it's scary to deal with daily.
Unluckylonerguy|@DepressedDude96 I mean like most young adults can live on their own w/ a minimum wage job and I doubt that I can do the same thing!
Unluckylonerguy|Why is it so hard to find and make money?
Unluckylonerguy|I'm only going to miss all my customers who loved me before I quit. They'll forever be in my hearts and thoughts.
Unluckylonerguy|Praying to God and all the angels above me that I get an easy, conflict-free job soon. 🙏
Unluckylonerguy|Have you ever regret being yourself back in high school as everyone judges and not liking you?
Unluckylonerguy|Sucks to be used for sex by someone that's not worth it. Now I'm back in the dust looking for a new romantic partner.
Unluckylonerguy|Why do some parents enjoy putting their own kids down? Like what's the point of them giving birth to kids then raising them for years?
Unluckylonerguy|It's so hard to find a job. I felt like my face scares every interviewer at the time when I shook hands and greet with them.
Unluckylonerguy|College is so hard, especially I know that there will be huge consequences if I give up right now.
Unluckylonerguy|Omg! So accurate! 🙏🏻 https://t.co/eV4WTlAxCL
Unluckylonerguy|I thought that I'm the only one who thinks like that... https://t.co/0CngCncGVg
Unluckylonerguy|Welcome to my dark world, folks. Anyone else out there who also feels the same and need someone, I'm here for you (promise)! ❤️

anxietyfull_|you talked to me. I blew it. i’m sorry
anxietyfull_|I just want to sleep eternally
anxietyfull_|i’m not sure how much longer I can stay clean, the razor is tempting me

anxietyfull_|lol @ my mental state
anxietyfull_|i’m sorry, but I don’t have a will to live anymore.
anxietyfull_|I love being invisible to the people that matter the most🙃
anxietyfull_|not being good enough is the worst feeling
anxietyfull_|honestly, all I can ever think about is going home and pressing that razor into my skin
anxietyfull_|I might have stopped cutting, but the urge to continue is always going to be there
anxietyfull_|i'm tired
anxietyfull_|do I like girls? boys? anyone? nobody?
anxietyfull_|sexuality is such a weird concept
anxietyfull_|"mindset: ""the scars. the dreadful scars. they seem to be everywhere. hide them. hide them well. don't allow anyone to see them."""
anxietyfull_|current state of mind: I don't deserve anything good. I never will.
anxietyfull_|"""hide the cuts. hide the scars. don't let people see them. they'll talk about you. they'll judge you."" - the depression in your head"
anxietyfull_|im sorry im depressed. i'm sorry that i'm not as happy anymore. i'm sorry it's hard for me to talk to people I used to talk to no problem.
anxietyfull_|i'm sorry i'm not who I was. i'm sorry I changed for the worse. sometimes you can't help what overcomes you.
anxietyfull_|all I can think about is killing myself
anxietyfull_|you were ever mine, but it felt like maybe one day you could be
anxietyfull_|i've lost hope in us. i've lost hope in having a relationship with you.
anxietyfull_|I WANT A BOYFRIEND. BUT NOT ANY BOYFRIEND. I WANT YOU. GET A CLUE.
anxietyfull_|WHY DO I ALLOW MYSELF TO GET SO ATTACHED SO QUICKLY
anxietyfull_|I TOLD MYSELF I WASNT FALLING FOR YOU. I TOLD MYSELF ITS NOT A POSSIBILITY AND HERE I AM WORRYING ABOUT YOU
anxietyfull_|i want to die so badly.
anxietyfull_|as days go by i want to die more than usual
anxietyfull_|when i was little i didn't understand how people could be so sad, cut themselves, or starve themselves, but as i grew older i understood.
anxietyfull_|i don't feel like i have a purpose here.
anxietyfull_|i could really use a best friend. sure, i have friends.. but not a best friend that will compliment me, make me feel comfortable
anxietyfull_|i want to feel wanted &amp; that's all
anxietyfull_|i want a relationship where we compliment each other &amp; lift each other up.
anxietyfull_|I just want to feel wanted
anxietyfull_|The feeling you get when you walk through the doors of school.
anxietyfull_|I try to look at the positives in life, but it's hard to when there is so much negative.
anxietyfull_|Somewhere between wanting to die and wanting to actually die.
anxietyfull_|Why spend money on makeup remover when your tears do it for free?
anxietyfull_|I hate walking into school. Every time I walk through those doors I start to freak out. My anxiety levels just skyrocket.
anxietyfull_|Why do Monday mornings have to be a thing? Why can't we just have a continuous weekend?
anxietyfull_|Maybe if I didn't overthink things 24/7 I could have a normal life. Yet.. I'm not sure what a normal life is..
anxietyfull_|My mind is constantly pacing. One moment I'm happy, and another I'm breaking down, crying.
anxietyfull_|It sucks when you like someone so much, but you can tell they don't like you back.
anxietyfull_|I want to eat everything.. but at the same time nothing..
anxietyfull_|How do I get a 4.0 gpa without studying?
anxietyfull_|Do you ever get the feeling you are doing everything wrong? But you don't know what you are doing wrong at the same time..
anxietyfull_|Everyone needs to stop getting upset when people ask for approval. How could we not ask for approval when we live in a world of approval?

DarkenedBroken |Im sorry for being such a disappointment

SadYoungInLove |Don’t make it all fade away, please...
SadYoungInLove |Don’t let the good times leave
SadYoungInLove |Hear my pleads, please
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want to feel alone
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want to be sad
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want to fall away again
SadYoungInLove |I’m not okay.
SadYoungInLove |I don’t feel okay.
SadYoungInLove |I just want to feel the blades pressed against my skin as red leaks out
SadYoungInLove |I wanna cut so bad
SadYoungInLove |It’s hard to kill the depression that eats away at your brain, destroying you from the inside.
SadYoungInLove |I’m happy?
SadYoungInLove |Why do things keep changing?
SadYoungInLove |It was supposed to be like last time.
SadYoungInLove |Why?
SadYoungInLove |Is this the end before the end?
SadYoungInLove |I don’t like her.
SadYoungInLove |fuck
SadYoungInLove |my heart aches.
SadYoungInLove |He can’t wait forever
SadYoungInLove |What happens if he moves on without me?
SadYoungInLove |Why can’t I have a nicer body, curves and nice hips and no stomach a big ass.
SadYoungInLove |Why can’t I be like the girls he wants.
SadYoungInLove |I’m not good enough.
SadYoungInLove |I think you realize that someone doesn’t care as much as they said when they don’t see what’s happening as much as… https://t.co/Jg8mZk0kmL
SadYoungInLove |if you don’t want to be with me, just say.
SadYoungInLove |If I cry all the time, why not just end it all and die?
SadYoungInLove |I want to slit my wrists and say goodbye.
SadYoungInLove |I’m sad.
SadYoungInLove |Do you even care anymore?
SadYoungInLove |Our time is lessening and you’re not realizing.
SadYoungInLove |When’s the last time we spent that much time together?
SadYoungInLove |I don’t like her or trust her.
SadYoungInLove |I know you said sorry, but you really hurt me.
SadYoungInLove |I can’t trust anyone.
SadYoungInLove |I want to be alive.
SadYoungInLove |I wanna feel sweet release.
SadYoungInLove |I’m tempted to go on a bridge, lean back, and let go.
SadYoungInLove |I think I want to die
SadYoungInLove |I wanna chug a bottle of pills.
SadYoungInLove |I wanna slit my wrists
SadYoungInLove |I’m so fucking annoying.
SadYoungInLove |I should’ve known I was unloveable
SadYoungInLove |I’m too clingy
SadYoungInLove |I could die and no one would care
SadYoungInLove |I’m a waste of fucking space
SadYoungInLove |help me.
SadYoungInLove |I’ve been thinking too much
SadYoungInLove |I’m tempted to get new blades. good blades.
SadYoungInLove |do I want to die?
SadYoungInLove |but I don’t want to die.
SadYoungInLove |I just want this pain to end.
SadYoungInLove |I’m so sick and tired of crying.
SadYoungInLove |I don’t fucking know anymore.
SadYoungInLove |why do I put it as much effort as I can, only to not receive the same effort back?
SadYoungInLove |why do I try so hard?
SadYoungInLove |I don’t know what to believe anymore.
SadYoungInLove |I don’t know what to do anymore.
SadYoungInLove |it’s all lies.
SadYoungInLove |I really thought I was getting better.
SadYoungInLove |But this isn’t the first time I’ve given up, I’m giving up AGAIN.
SadYoungInLove |I’m giving up.
SadYoungInLove |I’m letting go of myself- of my life, of my will.
SadYoungInLove |I’m beginning to let go.
SadYoungInLove |I’ve tried for too long to fight the sadness, I think it’s time to just let it fully consume me.
SadYoungInLove |actually, I’m exhausted beyond comprehension.
SadYoungInLove |I’m just really tired.
SadYoungInLove |he’s probably going to leave me sooner of later.
SadYoungInLove |it’s all just temporary happiness.
SadYoungInLove |nobody really gives a shit.
SadYoungInLove |When will I no longer live with the burden of sadness?
SadYoungInLove |I’m in so much pain
SadYoungInLove |I need to cry in the comfort of your arms
SadYoungInLove |Please just hold me
SadYoungInLove |I’m in desperate need of hope
SadYoungInLove |I need to be loved right now
SadYoungInLove |I need a hug or some kind of physical affection
SadYoungInLove |I cut last night but the blade was so dull it barely did anything :(
SadYoungInLove |Oh wait, I’m me, of course I’m a mess and a mistake
SadYoungInLove |I’m so worthless
SadYoungInLove |I’m so useless
SadYoungInLove |I feel like such a shitty person
SadYoungInLove |merely a lost soul
SadYoungInLove |I’m just a hollow body
SadYoungInLove |What’s the point of living and breathing?
SadYoungInLove |Sometimes I really contemplate the point of it all
SadYoungInLove |God, I’m so broken
SadYoungInLove |hold me
SadYoungInLove |I haven’t cut since sometime in December, I’m about to change that though...
SadYoungInLove |I want to be alone but I also don’t want to be alone
SadYoungInLove |I want to I don’t know
SadYoungInLove |I wanna slit my wrists
SadYoungInLove |Oh God help me
SadYoungInLove |Do I even mean anything?
SadYoungInLove |I’m scared and he doesn’t completely know why
SadYoungInLove |Things used to be so different
SadYoungInLove |But even when it stops hurting as much as it used to, there’s still a small, lingering pain
SadYoungInLove |Once you get used to something, it stops hurting as much
SadYoungInLove |I’m pleading for help but nobody can see my struggle.
SadYoungInLove |I’m screaming but nobody can hear me.
SadYoungInLove |I’m drowning in my own sorrows.
SadYoungInLove |I’m slowly but surely giving up.
SadYoungInLove |I can’t remember a time where I wasn’t a mess
SadYoungInLove |My heart aches at the thought of being without you
SadYoungInLove |Too many tears
SadYoungInLove |So many years have fallen down my cheek
SadYoungInLove |Why did things change?
SadYoungInLove |You used to want to spend time with me
SadYoungInLove |Things used to be different
SadYoungInLove |You can’t even hang out with me
SadYoungInLove |Welp that hurt
SadYoungInLove |I’m done getting my hopes up
SadYoungInLove |Do you even care anymore?
SadYoungInLove |I’m sick of crying and feeling like dying
SadYoungInLove |I can’t anymore
SadYoungInLove |Why why why
SadYoungInLove |Why?
SadYoungInLove |Why do you lie?
SadYoungInLove |What’s the point anymore?
SadYoungInLove |I get my hopes up, o my to get hurt
SadYoungInLove |I get my hopes up, only to be let down
SadYoungInLove |Why do I even get my hopes up?
SadYoungInLove |I’m sick of getting my hopes up
SadYoungInLove |I’m in so much pain
SadYoungInLove |I cried so much yesterday
SadYoungInLove |please make the bad thoughts stop...
SadYoungInLove |everything hurts.
SadYoungInLove |That physical pain in your chest when somebody does or says something but you have to act totally fine and smile like everything’s okay
SadYoungInLove |I’m tired
SadYoungInLove |Why am I never good enough?
SadYoungInLove |Why am I not good enough?
SadYoungInLove |I don’t understand
SadYoungInLove |I say that it hurts yet it’s still done
SadYoungInLove |Sometimes I feel like he doesn’t love me
SadYoungInLove |There’s no point anymore
SadYoungInLove |I cried again today :(
SadYoungInLove |But my last tweet is ironic isn’t it?
SadYoungInLove |I crave the feeling of being emotionless
SadYoungInLove |I’ve cried five times this month so far. Please don’t let the sixth happen right now.
SadYoungInLove |Make the bad thoughts stop
SadYoungInLove |Please make it stop
SadYoungInLove |I don’t wanna cry this much anymore
SadYoungInLove |I don’t wanna fall, fall away
SadYoungInLove |Calling me a liar physically pains me
SadYoungInLove |I hate being called a liar
SadYoungInLove |But it’s okay when you do it right?
SadYoungInLove |Fuck me right?
SadYoungInLove |I’ve only cried like three times since the year started and it may not seem like a lot but to me it is
SadYoungInLove |I’ve been fairly happy lately...I hope it lasts
SadYoungInLove |I feel so worthless
SadYoungInLove |not being answered makes me feel like I did something wrong
SadYoungInLove |":)- what I show
:(- what I feel"
SadYoungInLove |I’m trying to not cut but it’s so hard not to
SadYoungInLove |I can’t cope with the idea of you leaving me, so please don’t fucking go
SadYoungInLove |Please don’t leave me
SadYoungInLove |I’m scared
SadYoungInLove |why
SadYoungInLove |numb.
SadYoungInLove |But I also don’t miss being emotionless
SadYoungInLove |I miss being emotionless
SadYoungInLove |I don’t wanna cry this much anymore
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want him to know how much I cry at night when I’m texting him goodnight
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want him to know that I’ve written three suicide notes to him within the last few months
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want him to know the amount of times I’ve held pills in my hand and contemplated chugging all of them
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want him to know that I hold a blade against my wrists, contemplating whether or not I should press down and drag
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want him to know how close I get to suicide sometimes
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want him to know the depths of my thoughts
SadYoungInLove |Have you ever been so sad to the point where you can physically feel the pain? Yeah? Me too
SadYoungInLove |Have you ever been so sad that you can just feel your heart drop?
SadYoungInLove |I am a ball of depression
SadYoungInLove |I’m so annoying and frustrating
SadYoungInLove |I hate that I constantly need reassurance
SadYoungInLove |Nothing is ever going to be okay
SadYoungInLove |Then again I am a disappointment so I shouldn’t expect much
SadYoungInLove |I set myself up for disappointment.
SadYoungInLove |Why do I always get so excited and happy even when I know it’s not gonna happen?
SadYoungInLove |I’m sick and tired of always getting my hopes up.
SadYoungInLove |we’re still looking up
SadYoungInLove |how old is your soul?
SadYoungInLove |when I look into your eyes, it’s like watching the night sky
SadYoungInLove |I’m a disappointment
SadYoungInLove |tired
SadYoungInLove |I just want everything to be okay
SadYoungInLove |I’m a whirlwind of emotions
SadYoungInLove |I want him to hold me and take the pain away for good
SadYoungInLove |so many feelings
SadYoungInLove |Maybe even slit my wristd
SadYoungInLove |I’m just gonna go chug a bottle of pills
SadYoungInLove |I wanna fucking die :)
SadYoungInLove |I spoke too soon
SadYoungInLove |Today wasn’t bad and neither was yesterday, maybe things are gonna get better :)
SadYoungInLove |I am empty
SadYoungInLove |I’m not living
SadYoungInLove |I’m not truly alive
SadYoungInLove |I’m just a hollow, breathing body
SadYoungInLove |I’m constantly living with the burden of pain
SadYoungInLove |I feel empth
SadYoungInLove |I don’t mean anything to anyone
SadYoungInLove |sliding a blade across the veins of my wrist gently, picturing what it would be like to press down hard and completely
SadYoungInLove |holding a blade against the veins of my wrist
SadYoungInLove |I don’t want to die, but I also do
SadYoungInLove |highkey wanna just slit my wrists right now and end it all
SadYoungInLove |I wanna chug a bottle of pills
SadYoungInLove |bring colour to my skies
SadYoungInLove |dry my eyes
SadYoungInLove |take me away
SadYoungInLove |please don’t go...
SadYoungInLove |i’m so fucking fat
SadYoungInLove |i want to die quite frequently
SadYoungInLove |and i’m the liar?
SadYoungInLove |this is why i should never get my hopes up
SadYoungInLove |Not one good fucking day
SadYoungInLove |Never ending pain
SadYoungInLove |negative, painful thoughts cloud my mind
SadYoungInLove |consistent pain
SadYoungInLove |overthinking is a killer
SadYoungInLove |when will my depression disappear?
SadYoungInLove |when will this pain end?
SadYoungInLove |everything fucking hurts
SadYoungInLove |today was a good day until I started to overthink.
SadYoungInLove |alive.
SadYoungInLove |Goodnight.
SadYoungInLove |I’ve reached the end and it’s dark and frightening
SadYoungInLove |Tonight is my last night
SadYoungInLove |I’ve arrived at the goodbyes I think
SadYoungInLove |I might attempt again tonight :(
SadYoungInLove |Goodbye. I’m scared to say goodbye. Please don’t let me get to the goodbyes.
SadYoungInLove |The clock is ticking and so is the time left in my life
SadYoungInLove |save me before it’s too late because baby, I don’t have much time left
SadYoungInLove |please notice. please help me.
SadYoungInLove |My ass is small and not fat, yet every other part of my body is
SadYoungInLove |My fat sticks out everywhere, but not where I want
SadYoungInLove |I need to lose weight
SadYoungInLove |I’ve hated my body for years, off and on and now I’m getting bad again
SadYoungInLove |my body is so disgusting
SadYoungInLove |It’s not that I don’t like her, I’m just scared
SadYoungInLove |I bet you’ll notice when it’s too late. I bet you’ll notice when I’m six feet under.
SadYoungInLove |Do you not realize my obvious signs pleading for you to speak for me and to help me?
SadYoungInLove |Do you not notice my tweets or silenced text messages as a cry for help?
SadYoungInLove |Do you not notice when I’m on the verge of beginning to cry?
SadYoungInLove |Do you not notice how much I say I wanna die?
SadYoungInLove |Hold me tight and promise to never let go
SadYoungInLove |I'll change, I promise I change, just please don't leave. Please, please don't leave me
SadYoungInLove |I thought I meant more to you but then I see that and something else and do you really love me anymore?
SadYoungInLove |am I just a distraction or a temporary thing?
SadYoungInLove |so you don't want a future with me?
SadYoungInLove |do you ever feel so hurt, that you just feel like throwing up or passing out? Yeah? Because me too 😕
SadYoungInLove |I won't eat as much and I'll work out and I'll do whatever it takes as long as you're pleased and happy with me
SadYoungInLove |if it's my body, i can change it. I promise
SadYoungInLove |please, please tell me if you're still in love with her, it would hurt so much less knowing now
SadYoungInLove |i just wanna feel good enough for once
SadYoungInLove |i knew I wasn't good enough
SadYoungInLove |i just wanna feel your lips against mine
SadYoungInLove |:(((
SadYoungInLove |just tell me if you still love her, it'll hurt less knowing now rather than later
SadYoungInLove |it's okay if you don't love me anymore :(
SadYoungInLove |the stars and the night sky don't compare to the beauty and perfection of you
SadYoungInLove |take me back to the night we met ✨
SadYoungInLove |I'm sick of constantly having tears streaming down my cheeks
SadYoungInLove |I'm sick of crying so much
SadYoungInLove |heartbroken over the thought of losing you
SadYoungInLove |so not forever?
SadYoungInLove |Please, please, please don't leave me
SadYoungInLove |please no
SadYoungInLove |I'm so fucking in love with him
SadYoungInLove |I am genuinely a fuck up
SadYoungInLove |But baby, you can't save me from this overwhelming, eternal sadness
SadYoungInLove |I'm sad baby
SadYoungInLove |I relapsed again
SadYoungInLove |Hear me and see me, feel me and help me before I fall and completely drown
SadYoungInLove |Please, please save me before it's too late
SadYoungInLove |Help me
SadYoungInLove |I'm in love with the shape of you
SadYoungInLove |You shouldn't rely on someone for your happiness, but I'm guilty of doing it
SadYoungInLove |I need him
SadYoungInLove |I am so sick of overthinking everything
SadYoungInLove |Why must I overthink so much?
SadYoungInLove |Do you still love me?
SadYoungInLove |I'm drowning
SadYoungInLove |That moment when you're breathing and 'living' even though you're not really alive and actually living- a hollow body
SadYoungInLove |I'm alive.
SadYoungInLove |i am going to commit suicide tonight
SadYoungInLove |done.
SadYoungInLove |I wanna see the slices in my thighs and continue making new ones
SadYoungInLove |I wanna feel the blood dripping down my arms
SadYoungInLove |In love, with you
SadYoungInLove |Love
SadYoungInLove |I am me. And being me means being ugly and disgusting and imperfect
SadYoungInLove |I am disgusting
SadYoungInLove |I'm ugly
SadYoungInLove |Ass too flat and not enough fat
SadYoungInLove |Not pretty enough
SadYoungInLove |Not smart enough
SadYoungInLove |Not skinny enough
SadYoungInLove |shit always gotta be fucked up
SadYoungInLove |I'd do anything for you
SadYoungInLove |Impossible to truly love
SadYoungInLove |How could anybody ever truly love me? I'm me
SadYoungInLove |Baby, I'm in love with you
SadYoungInLove |So many emotions that revolve around you and only you
SadYoungInLove |Being in love means that your whole universe revolvesAround 1person-the most important person inYourlife.A human that you'llGive your all to
SadYoungInLove |Being in love means doing everything and anything for that one person-it means that you can't live without them &amp; thinking of that kills you
SadYoungInLove |Being in love pertains to that one significant other,your one and only, a human that you love everything about including their imperfections
SadYoungInLove |Loving someone means constantly being there and having their back no matter what
SadYoungInLove |His beauty if baffling
SadYoungInLove |Major difference between loving someone and being in love with someone
SadYoungInLove |The skies may be gray at times,but all you need is that one little spec of blue to see everything in a new light-to see the beauty of it all
SadYoungInLove |Life is beautiful.
SadYoungInLove |Love is scary, but being in love is terrifying
SadYoungInLove |I am in love with you
SadYoungInLove |you'll never know dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away
SadYoungInLove |You make me happy when skies are gray
SadYoungInLove |you are my sunshine
SadYoungInLove |I try to be good enough and I'm sorry I'm not
SadYoungInLove |I want us to be forever
SadYoungInLove |You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, so please don't go.
SadYoungInLove |If you leave me, you have to promise not to forget me like everyone else,Okay?
SadYoungInLove |Love is addictive.
SadYoungInLove |Your love is like a drug
SadYoungInLove |Being in love is such a scary thing
SadYoungInLove |Why am I such a fuuuckup
SadYoungInLove |But I believe in God &amp;I hope this is a test to see if I keep faith.To see if I will ever give up on him-I mean I won't but it's still hard
SadYoungInLove |Life just gotta throw these obstacles at me and I honestly can't anymore
SadYoungInLove |I swear life hates me sometimes
SadYoungInLove |Petrified of who you are and who you have become
SadYoungInLove |That feeling of being completely alone even though you're not actually alone..... well physically at least
SadYoungInLove |What happens if I'm just a month thing and then you leave and give up
SadYoungInLove |But I don't know how long you wanna keep this going
SadYoungInLove |I don't want this to end
SadYoungInLove |And You'll eventually see me the way I see myself
SadYoungInLove |You'll eventually get tired of me constantly putting myself down and being depressed
SadYoungInLove |I know you're going to eventually leave me, it's just a matter of time
SadYoungInLove |we're so different yet so alike in ways you'll never understand
SadYoungInLove |I just want to help
SadYoungInLove |I see such a strong future for us both but I don't know if you do too
SadYoungInLove |I value u over me so don't tel me to not feel&amp;do things a certain way.U matter more to me than myself&amp;u need to understand that won't change
SadYoungInLove |Just because you tell me not to care doesn't mean I'll stop
SadYoungInLove |Thinking is so dangerous yet beautiful
SadYoungInLove |Currently trying to keep myself from falling completely down again
SadYoungInLove |There's never just complete happiness, something always has to go wrong and happen
SadYoungInLove |There always has to be something up
SadYoungInLove |Sometimes I just wanna go to asleep for awhile... or maybe just forever
SadYoungInLove |One minute I'm happy but the next I'm sad
SadYoungInLove |As our skin touched, sparks flew and Everything felt so surreal yet so perfect and amazing
SadYoungInLove |When his lips touched mine I felt the fire within me set aflame
SadYoungInLove |I love him right?
SadYoungInLove |are you fucking kidding me? this bullshit has to happen and fuck everything up
SadYoungInLove |I don't understand what's happening but I like it yet hate it at the same time
SadYoungInLove |I think he likes me but he probably doesn't because I'm me and everybody leaves eventually
SadYoungInLove |Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
SadYoungInLove |I'm ready to fly in foreign land
SadYoungInLove |His shining blue eyes bore into my soul as we catch eyes only for a second.His toothy smirk burns scars inMy skin AsWe communicateWith 1word
SadYoungInLove |I wanna sleep next to you
SadYoungInLove |I'm tired
SadYoungInLove |It's sad that we never even dated yet in left so heartbroken about us not talking anymore
SadYoungInLove |It's funny how fast things can change
SadYoungInLove |FUCK ME AND MY FUCKING LIFE HE WILL NEVER LOVE ME FUCK
SadYoungInLove |My eyes are rimmed red
SadYoungInLove |But I want to hold him close and never let go
SadYoungInLove |I know he doesn't like me
SadYoungInLove |I don't know what to do
SadYoungInLove |Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
SadYoungInLove |Love fucking hurts, it hurts too fuckig much
SadYoungInLove |Fuck
SadYoungInLove |I think I'm really fucking falling for him and it hurts and it sucks because I know he'd never feel the same way about me
SadYoungInLove |I'm seeing things I've never seen in him before- I'm opening my eyes and realizing how fucking amazing he is
SadYoungInLove |He's perfect
SadYoungInLove |I'm drowning
SadYoungInLove |I'm so tired of being down all the time
SadYoungInLove |I'm still fucking sad
SadYoungInLove |But having a crush doesn't mean it'll happen
SadYoungInLove |I really like him
SadYoungInLove |We've talked a lot the last few days
SadYoungInLove |I don't talk to him much either but I think I like him
SadYoungInLove |I thought I loved her and I think I still do but we don't talk much anymore
SadYoungInLove |But I think about her whenever he comes to mine and I just don't know
SadYoungInLove |He would never like me
SadYoungInLove |I think I might like him
SadYoungInLove |I feel like I'm drowning and everyone's watching but nobody's listening
SadYoungInLove |I feel dead
SadYoungInLove |I want someone to hold me so close it feels like we're connected- both physically and mentally
SadYoungInLove |Life is just an endless cycle of sadness
SadYoungInLove |Would you still love me if you saw my body littered with scars?
SadYoungInLove |What the fuck is the point?
SadYoungInLove |I've only felt pain
SadYoungInLove |Life sucks
SadYoungInLove |I don't fucking care
SadYoungInLove |The only thing better than life is death unless I have you
SadYoungInLove |What's the meaning of life?
SadYoungInLove |Love is pain
SadYoungInLove |She won't love me like I love her
SadYoungInLove |I think I'm in love
SadYoungInLove |I'm drifting away
SadYoungInLove |Darling you can't fix what's already been broken
SadYoungInLove |The scars will never go away
SadYoungInLove |Hold me close and never let go
SadYoungInLove |I don't want to be alone anymore- I want you
SadYoungInLove |I want to call you mine
SadYoungInLove |I think I'm in love with you but I know I'll never have you
SadYoungInLove |I'm sad darling

broken_girl922|My life is just a huge mistake
broken_girl922|Even though I’m used to it, it still hurts seeing people slowly fall out of love with me.
broken_girl922|Whatever.
broken_girl922|I’m done with trying to make people happy.
broken_girl922|When people say “what’s wrong with you?” 😡
broken_girl922|People keep lying 😭
broken_girl922|I need to shut off my mind. I need to die.
broken_girl922|I hate emotions 😭
broken_girl922|Haven’t eaten in 3days!
broken_girl922|Overthinking is so dangerous.
broken_girl922|I’ll actually pay someone to hit me with their car and make it look like and accident.
broken_girl922|When you watch the Bent Neck Lady scene over and over because that’s your end goal.
broken_girl922|I just wanna sit and curl up in ball and ignore the world.
broken_girl922|Don’t make promises you can’t keep.
broken_girl922|It a living hell inside my head. #anxious  #hell
broken_girl922|I can hear the voices in my yelling at me to cut again 😭
broken_girl922|I hate myself #depressed #anxiety
broken_girl922|I’m an emotional wreck.
broken_girl922|So much for being 67 days clean.
broken_girl922|When you see the train coming into the station and it takes everything not to jump.
broken_girl922|I hate feelings.
broken_girl922|Fake smiles all day every day.
broken_girl922|When you’re actually a superhero and have the ability to be completely invisible.
broken_girl922|#numb
broken_girl922|The next person who ask’s me “are you okay?” Is going to get their face punched. Fuck no I’m not okay stupid.
broken_girl922|I’m too damaged for anyone to love me.
broken_girl922|I don’t want to live another week
broken_girl922|No body likes me, No body cares, No one would notice is I disappeared.
broken_girl922|Stressed and depressed.
broken_girl922|When people start to give you mixed signals...
broken_girl922|Do you ever get into a mental state and start feeling like your a psycho path and completely crazy?
broken_girl922|When your super hungry, chew gum! It makes your body think your full and you don’t actually have to eat.
broken_girl922|Who else feels like they need to get their weight down!? 🙋🏼‍♀️
broken_girl922|I’m just empty right now
broken_girl922|I actually am so done. I can’t take people’s BS anymore.
broken_girl922|People fucking suck
broken_girl922|I can’t.
broken_girl922|I don’t have any more fight left in me.
broken_girl922|Someone please tell me what the fuck is wrong with me.
broken_girl922|I hate eating, I keep getting fat.
broken_girl922|I hate being alive
broken_girl922|As soon as I open my eyes in the morning, I can’t wait to go back to bed
broken_girl922|I can’t be like this anymore.
broken_girl922|I didn’t know existing could be so exhausting
broken_girl922|When you feel worthless as fuck.
broken_girl922|I fucking hate people.
broken_girl922|I can’t do one fucking thing right.
broken_girl922|I really am at the last straw, I don’t think I can do this anymore.
broken_girl922|I hate people
broken_girl922|We are born to die... so if I killed myself, technically its what I was born to do.
broken_girl922|I actually don’t have any friends
broken_girl922|My head hurts so much from over thinking.
broken_girl922|Do you ever just get so mentally overwhelmed that all you want to do is throw a tantrum?
broken_girl922|I can’t handle my thoughts any more.
broken_girl922|If I was dead... all the voices in my head would shut up.
broken_girl922|I can’t pretend to be okay anymore
broken_girl922|Why did I eat today?
broken_girl922|Pride events 🏳️‍🌈 are the only time I feel accepted.
broken_girl922|When your in class, and you can actually hear people laughing at you.
broken_girl922|I hate myself so much.
broken_girl922|I’m so done with fighting.
broken_girl922|I’m tired of breathing
broken_girl922|Look at the books I read, look at my screen savers, look at what I wear, look at my eyes. Can you see I’m struggling inside.
broken_girl922|One step forward... three steps back. I can’t win.
broken_girl922|Tired of trying.
broken_girl922|Slowly falling to pieces.
broken_girl922|I just want to stop feeling everything
broken_girl922|I just need to not be here
broken_girl922|Lyrics seem to matter so much more when your sad because you pay attention to every word.
broken_girl922|I just hate feeling like this. i hate myself, for being ugly, fat, horrible, a weirdo, a freak, a bitch.
broken_girl922|I want to give up.
broken_girl922|I kinda feel like crying, kinda feel like dying, kinda feel like sleeping my life away, kinda feel like screaming a… https://t.co/B3TSEnv9hj
broken_girl922|Drink the pain away and pop a pill so you won’t remember it.
broken_girl922|There’s so much going on in my mind.
broken_girl922|Depression is being colourblind and constantly told how colourful the world is.
broken_girl922|Everyone makes me feel like shit.
broken_girl922|I can’t make it through a day with out crying 😭
broken_girl922|I can’t do it anymore
broken_girl922|Where’s the re-start button on life?
broken_girl922|I question my existence like 20times a day.
broken_girl922|Society is so fucked up.
broken_girl922|My soul is sad, I don’t know what to do, but I’m a mess, all because of you.
broken_girl922|I hate when boys play with my heart 😭😭
broken_girl922|I haven’t gotten better, I just got better at hiding it.
broken_girl922|There’s no point in getting out of bed anymore.
broken_girl922|I’m nothing.
broken_girl922|I’m so ashamed of myself.
broken_girl922|I’m not good enough for anyone.
broken_girl922|My mind is a horror story.
broken_girl922|I’m so mentally exhausted.
broken_girl922|My thoughts destroy me
broken_girl922|My mind constantly yells and talks to me more then any person would ever talk to me.
broken_girl922|Why am I still breathing?
broken_girl922|I just want to shut out the world, but at the same time, I feel I’m already invisible to the world.
broken_girl922|I hate having to pretend I’m not sad.
broken_girl922|At this point, I don’t think I will ever be able to trust someone again.
broken_girl922|I constantly have the feeling that no one actually cares and they are just pretending.
broken_girl922|I know I’m difficult, but that doesn’t mean I don’t love you.
broken_girl922|Fairy tales are lies. Why do parents get their kids hope up with these stories??
broken_girl922|I’m so ashamed of myself all the time
broken_girl922|Emotions will be the fucking end of me.
broken_girl922|I really fucked up 😭
broken_girl922|Feeling sad for no reason, sucks more then being sad for a reason.
broken_girl922|No matter how bad things seem, I always make them worse.
broken_girl922|https://t.co/cKbaBAHltC
broken_girl922|If Only i could lose wait by over thinking...
broken_girl922|I’m sorry for everything. But words don’t matter.
broken_girl922|Ohhh it feels so good to self harm again.
broken_girl922|People say hate is strong word. But so is love. People just throw that word around thinking it’s nothing.
broken_girl922|I don’t hate you. I love you. But it’s killing me.
broken_girl922|Sometimes not telling people anything is the best thing.
broken_girl922|I’m the kind of person who will just randomly stop talking because I feel like I’m bothering people
broken_girl922|I don’t blame anyone. I did this to myself. It’s my fault. EVERYTHING is my fault.
broken_girl922|Kinda want to admit myself to the hospital, kinda wanna just see what happens.
broken_girl922|I feel self harm is more calming then talking to people.
broken_girl922|I swear I say “I want to die” like 10 times a day.
broken_girl922|Emotions are not meant to be played with!
broken_girl922|Don’t have the energy to exist.
broken_girl922|Just one little thing can make me feel so miserable.
broken_girl922|Thanks for playing with my feeling and emotions😒 just another reason to not trust people.
broken_girl922|The sun will still rise when I’m dead.
broken_girl922|Don’t fall in love.
broken_girl922|Can’t wait for my day that’s less then 24 hours long.
broken_girl922|I don’t mean to ruin everything.
broken_girl922|Twitter: What’s happening?                       Me: oh you know just contemplating suicide. Hbu?
broken_girl922|I can’t do it anymore
broken_girl922|More into music and then people tbh.
broken_girl922|Society is fucked.
broken_girl922|I’m a disappointment.
broken_girl922|Just breathing not living.
broken_girl922|Fake smile, don’t let people know your hurting.
broken_girl922|I don’t think I have the energy or willingness to save myself anymore.
broken_girl922|I don’t want to care about anyone or anything, but yet I care too much about both.
broken_girl922|Have you ever just been disappointed in yourself because ur not dead yet?
broken_girl922|Do you ever just cry because you exist?
broken_girl922|I don’t want to be with my mind all the time.
broken_girl922|When you know your the unwanted one.
broken_girl922|Same bullshit EVERY DAY.
broken_girl922|I do something out of the kindness in my heart and I always get in trouble for it.
broken_girl922|Truth is... even if I’m not sad, I’m still not happy.
broken_girl922|I love to isolate myself because no one is there to judge me... but when I isolate I overthink...
broken_girl922|Every time I close my eyes, I see myself hanging... is that a sign?
broken_girl922|I don’t even know why I’m sad anymore, I’m just used to it.
broken_girl922|Why are emotions so difficult to control!?
broken_girl922|What the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I like this?
broken_girl922|I miss you, but you aren’t you anymore.
broken_girl922|No matter how much makeup I put on I still look ugly.
broken_girl922|I hate talking to pretty people.
broken_girl922|It’s hard to be alive when you feel like shit everyday,
broken_girl922|Why can’t I be dead already?
broken_girl922|Why can’t things that are good just stay?
broken_girl922|I need to shut out all those voices in my head.
broken_girl922|My mind is so messed up. But yet it’s my normal.
broken_girl922|I need a hug from that one certain person.
broken_girl922|I’m crazy
broken_girl922|I swear I annoy every person who speaks to me.
broken_girl922|No matter how hard I try to be your everything, I’ll always be your nothing.
broken_girl922|Feeling like shit is my normal feeling.
broken_girl922|I swear I say I hate myself 25 times a day.
broken_girl922|I want to know what it feels like to think of yourself as pretty.
broken_girl922|Constantly drowning in my own thoughts.
broken_girl922|No body likes me, no body cares, no one would noticed if I disappeared
broken_girl922|I think I care way to much about everyone else because I know what it’s like not to be cared about at all.
broken_girl922|I don’t even know what to say anymore
broken_girl922|Generally I hate mirrors more then I hate people.
broken_girl922|I wish people would take the time to really understand what a mental illness is. NO ITS NOT A CHOICE.
broken_girl922|My hardest is never enough
broken_girl922|Too mentally exhausted to even get out of bed today.
broken_girl922|My mind is like a maze, except there's no exit.
broken_girl922|I feel unsafe if I'm left alone
broken_girl922|Mentally I'm not okay, physically I'm not okay, I'm just not okay
broken_girl922|Cuts are apart of me and that's okay.
broken_girl922|I'm not ashamed of my cuts.. it shows I'm strong and that I'm still here.
broken_girl922|I'm so tired of being me
broken_girl922|Depressed is the new normal
broken_girl922|When you think ur done cutting but then....
broken_girl922|Feel like shit but what else is new
broken_girl922|I'm tired of being me.
broken_girl922|Why is everything so difficult for me?
broken_girl922|Just wants to go somewhere where no one knows my name and I can start over.
broken_girl922|In the end, death will always win.
broken_girl922|Controlling facial expressions is like having a superpower
broken_girl922|So endlessly fucking tired of everything.
broken_girl922|My mind is like a dark paradise
broken_girl922|I hate mirrors.
broken_girl922|I want my weight to be as low as my self esteem.
broken_girl922|No feelings, no emotions, just numb.
broken_girl922|Happiness seems so far away.
broken_girl922|I wonder what it feels like to give a real smile.
broken_girl922|I have no words for what I think.
broken_girl922|People are temporary
broken_girl922|Fear what you become.
broken_girl922|I'm so sorry for the way I am.
broken_girl922|Some days I feel everything at once, other days I feel nothing at all.
broken_girl922|I feel so lost
broken_girl922|Reality is an illusion.
broken_girl922|Life is just a game, no one gets out alive.
broken_girl922|I feel so disconnected from the world, and I feel like no one even notices me or cares about me anymore.
broken_girl922|I'm sorry. I thought you meant what you promised. Guess I was just kidding myself.
broken_girl922|If I wouldn't even choose myself, why would anyone else?
broken_girl922|I think I'm the biggest mistake in my life right now.
broken_girl922|I wish I could stop thinking
broken_girl922|Why do I only see the negatives in life?
broken_girl922|That moment when you feel completely empty.
broken_girl922|Why can't I focus on things for more then a min?
broken_girl922|I wish I could shut my mind off, it's so fucking noisy in there.
broken_girl922|Do you ever just walk the halls at school and think to yourself, if I was dead it wouldn't even make a difference?
broken_girl922|Yes I always start the conversations, but shouldn't that show you how much I care, rather then just annoying?
broken_girl922|I don't know what the fuck is going on anymore.
broken_girl922|I'm actually so tired of fake people.
broken_girl922|Don't push me away then wonder where I went.
broken_girl922|Feelings are dangerous.
broken_girl922|Late night thoughts 😭
broken_girl922|No one knows for certain how much impact they really have on other people's lives.
broken_girl922|I think most people are trying to say the right thing, they just don't know how.
broken_girl922|We're all guilty of something.
broken_girl922|I wish I could be in an accident and die, so I don't hurt the ones around me when I'm gone.
broken_girl922|It sucks when ur so depressed that it becomes ur normal feeling.
broken_girl922|Why can't anyone... fix me? Why can't I fix myself?
broken_girl922|If you don't care about yourself, your always are going to feel like people are just pretending to care about you.
broken_girl922|Honestly... no I'm not okay. Actually I'm far from being okay.
broken_girl922|I just need a break from life.
broken_girl922|My life is a nightmare that I can't wake up from.
broken_girl922|I can't remember the last time I gave a smile that wasn't fake.
broken_girl922|When I'm alone I think... then I start overthinking what I just thought, then I become a total mess.
broken_girl922|I feel like I'm waiting for something that isn't even going to happen.
broken_girl922|I just want the pain to end.
broken_girl922|Words hurt... actions hurt... everything always ends up hurting.
broken_girl922|I always put others before myself, because I think maybe they would do the same for me, but in reality they don't give a shit.
broken_girl922|Can anyone please tell me what happiness feels like?
broken_girl922|My mind is a huge maze, and every turn is a dead end.
broken_girl922|Every time I look in a mirror I see an ugly reflection of myself.
broken_girl922|Who's going to love a girl who Self harms and hates herself?
broken_girl922|Pain is different for everyone, so don't tell me you understand.
broken_girl922|How did I become so addicted to self harm?
broken_girl922|Do u listen to what ur brain wants or what ur heart desires?
broken_girl922|I don't even know how I feel anymore
broken_girl922|That moment you realize you don't mean shit to anyone...
broken_girl922|I hope there's a day when I fall in love with being alive.
broken_girl922|I hate that I have to be around myself 24/7.
broken_girl922|I just want a day where it feels like nothing is falling apart anymore.
broken_girl922|I hate myself sooo much😭 I'll never be good enough.
broken_girl922|Giving up seems like a good option to me.
broken_girl922|My brain and my heart never agree, and it fucks me up
broken_girl922|I'm on a emotional roller coaster that's never going to end.
broken_girl922|I don't even know what's wrong anymore, I'm just sad.
broken_girl922|I'm tired of living.
broken_girl922|I wanna give up.
broken_girl922|Everyday I feel like I'm homesick for a place that dosent exist.
broken_girl922|I turn the music louder so I won't hear my thoughts, but it's stupid because the lyrics remind me of what I'm trying to forget.
broken_girl922|Every time people ask if I'm okay, it's just a reminder that I'm not.
broken_girl922|https://t.co/SoAQmflW7V
broken_girl922|Back to 0 days clean😔
broken_girl922|There was a time when I used to be happy.
broken_girl922|People don't understand what it's like having anxiety and depression at the same time.
broken_girl922|In a strange way I've fallen in love with my depression.
broken_girl922|The worst kind of sad is not being able to explain why.
broken_girl922|I don't get the point of trying anymore.
broken_girl922|Boys are stupid. End of story.
broken_girl922|😔😔 https://t.co/5dkGdKJ2LS
broken_girl922|I keep it all inside because I'd rather the pain destroy me, then everyone else.
broken_girl922|I'm not living, I'm just surviving.
broken_girl922|Can someone be proud of me. Like fuck I'm trying really hard.
broken_girl922|I feel like I'm waiting for something that isn't even going to happen.
broken_girl922|Drink. Sleep. Forget. Repeat
broken_girl922|Why does life have to be so hard?
broken_girl922|"""Im used to it"""
broken_girl922|I honestly don't even understand my own feelings.
broken_girl922|I have anger issues, I get annoyed fast asf, I can catch an attitude in 3 seconds, but I'm a sweetheart for real.
broken_girl922|... and then reality just slaps you really hard.
broken_girl922|I've come to a point where I either care too much or not at all... and I don't know what ones worse.
broken_girl922|Even when being surrounded by people I still feel so alone.
broken_girl922|I'm winning at losing in life.
broken_girl922|When I'm alone I think. And think. And think.
broken_girl922|Don't tell me you understand, because you don't.
broken_girl922|My mind is a mess
broken_girl922|I'm sorry I'm not what you wanted
broken_girl922|I'm not okay
broken_girl922|Getting used isn't a surprise to me anymore.
broken_girl922|I want to be dead.
broken_girl922|My life is a constant battle
broken_girl922|Thinking is tiring
broken_girl922|Late night thoughts -_-
broken_girl922|When you've been crying so much and ur teacher asks if your high
broken_girl922|😔😔 https://t.co/ag6oz2pFeR
broken_girl922|I hate eating
broken_girl922|Can't you just hold me for a while... please.
broken_girl922|I can't stand being around myself.
broken_girl922|You only know a part of me, I'm a universe full of secrets.
broken_girl922|"People say ""everything happens for a reason."" So what's the reason for me being so messed up?"
broken_girl922|I can't do this anymore
broken_girl922|That moment when you burst into tears in your room and you realize that no one knows how unhappy you are.
broken_girl922|I have a massive fear that no one actually likes me, rather everyone is politely tolerating me hoping I leave them alone.
broken_girl922|I hate myself so much.
broken_girl922|My mind is killing me
broken_girl922|Im so scared of what I do to myself
broken_girl922|It sucks when you don't know who you are anymore.
broken_girl922|Where all in the same game, just different levels. Dealing with the same hell, just different devils.
broken_girl922|I don't even know what happiness feels like anymore.
broken_girl922|I like to draw with silver, it comes out red. Magic?
broken_girl922|I don't feel like I'm terribly important to anyone anymore, I just kinda exist in people's life's.
broken_girl922|I wish my life had a delete button
broken_girl922|I look alive but I'm dead inside
broken_girl922|https://t.co/Cvk5lh8h1s
broken_girl922|You say you like me the way I am, but yet you're telling me to change everything.
broken_girl922|I've become so numb.
broken_girl922|The biggest mistake is thinking that people care for me, as much as I do for them.
broken_girl922|https://t.co/y6lPH7tQYb
broken_girl922|One day I will do it...
broken_girl922|Right now, I really don't see the reason for trying, for talking, or for breathing, I'm done.
broken_girl922|Pleased don't be surprised when one day you can't wake me up.
broken_girl922|If this is how my life is going to be, I don't want it anymore.
broken_girl922|I'm fine. https://t.co/hecMomluNO
broken_girl922|No one will really care until your dead.
broken_girl922|I'm nothing, I was always nothing.
broken_girl922|https://t.co/KAMemLnbwQ
broken_girl922|I can't even look at sharp objects anymore without judging how good they'ed be.
broken_girl922|When I was 6 I used to be terrified of getting hit by a car. Now I'm 17 and I hope I get hit by a car.
broken_girl922|No one needs me.
broken_girl922|I really don't want to be here
broken_girl922|I just want it all to end, I've had enough
broken_girl922|My thoughts are killing me.
broken_girl922|Would it be wrong, would it be right? If I took my life tonight.
broken_girl922|It's weird in how a matter of seconds you could just be a memory.
broken_girl922|Depression? It's like drowning but not being able to die
broken_girl922|Cutting is horrible, but then again so am I.
broken_girl922|I wonder who would notice if I disappeared?
broken_girl922|I hope my last breath is a sigh of relief
broken_girl922|I keep a lot of shit to myself because in reality NO ONE GIVES A FUCK!
broken_girl922|Why does it feel like people just pretend to like me?
broken_girl922|I just wanna cry, everything is falling apart
broken_girl922|"""She told you she's was down, you let it slip by, so from then on she kept it in the inside"""
broken_girl922|How could someone so loving, learn to hate her own guts?
broken_girl922|I'm so insecure.
broken_girl922|When you break down, cry, and have a anxiety attack then just sit there feeling completely empty.
broken_girl922|I'm losing my mind.
broken_girl922|No one will ever know your true story.
broken_girl922|"""What do you want for Christmas?"" To be dead, and not having to feel like shit everyday"
broken_girl922|"""It will get better"" BS it's been 12 years. No it won't."
broken_girl922|"When you start to feel ""normal"" again but your so used to being depressed that ""normal"" feels weird."
broken_girl922|I'm so fucking done.
broken_girl922|I hate who I am now, I hate who I was in the past.
broken_girl922|People need to understand that's it's not our fault we have depression, and it can't just go away over night!!
broken_girl922|I might still be ugly, but I used to be uglier.
broken_girl922|Idk what to think anymore.
broken_girl922|Why do people pretend to care? They will just hurt you more in the long run.
broken_girl922|Can't I just sleep forever and never wake up?
broken_girl922|I feel like I'm losing myself
broken_girl922|The same girl who smiles and talks non stop, is the same girl who cries herself to sleep at night.
broken_girl922|I'm not as strong as everyone thinks I am.
broken_girl922|I feel like such a disappointment.

broken_girl922|I hate getting flashbacks of things I don't want to remember
broken_girl922|Every thought is a battle, every breath is a war, and I don't think I'm winning anymore.
broken_girl922|Being alive isn't for everyone.
broken_girl922|Shy people notice everything, but they don't get noticed.
broken_girl922|My feelings? Oh don't worry about thoes, no one else does.
broken_girl922|"She cried, she wanted to die. ""I'm fine"" she lied."
broken_girl922|"""Maybe I'm better off dead if I was would it finally be enough to shut out all thoes voices in my head"" - sleeping with sirens."
broken_girl922|I get so attached to people, then push them away because Ik they will leave sooner or later.
broken_girl922|I hate the feeling after your done crying and you just sit there emotionless.
broken_girl922|Do you ever feel people just forget you exist?
broken_girl922|I want to kill what's inside my head.
broken_girl922|There's no more emotions, just numbness.
broken_girl922|What's wrong with me?
broken_girl922|I feel guilty for being alive.
broken_girl922|Tell me, where did I go wrong?
broken_girl922|I'm not totally useless, I can be used as a bad example.
broken_girl922|I'm falling apart right in front of your eyes and you don't even see me.
broken_girl922|Depression isn't always at 3am, it happens at 3pm, while your with your friends and half way through a smile.
broken_girl922|My silence is just another word for my pain
broken_girl922|But who could love a girl who's so fucked?
broken_girl922|I'm so fucking alone
broken_girl922|You hate me? I hate me too.
broken_girl922|I just need a break from life
broken_girl922|I wish I was beautiful. 😔
broken_girl922|Can't even express how many times I wanted to be dead.
broken_girl922|I'm afraid of what I'm doing to myself, but I can't seem to stop.
broken_girl922|Mirror mirror can't you see? What you show is killing me.
broken_girl922|My scars are fading, but I feel lost without them. 😔
broken_girl922|I'm addicted to my own self destruction
broken_girl922|She's smiling, but is she really happy?
broken_girl922|I feel like I bother people just by being alive.
broken_girl922|People want secret powers, well I already have one. I'm invisible
broken_girl922|It only takes one second and it can all be over 🔪
broken_girl922|Isolation is so easy for me to do, maybe that's my talent.
broken_girl922|Why do I keep trying even after I tell myself Im done?
broken_girl922|It sucks when people make it obvious you don't belong.
broken_girl922|"I swear I ask myself ""what's wrong with me"" at least 20 times a day."
broken_girl922|Emotionally I'm done, mentally I'm drained, spiritually I feel dead, physically I smile.
broken_girl922|"""I will always be there for you"" is the biggest lie I ever heard 😔"
broken_girl922|Why do I always over think everything!?
broken_girl922|Why does everyone assume shit?
broken_girl922|So mentally exhausted.
broken_girl922|"When you don't want people to ask questions, so all you say is ""I'm okay"""
broken_girl922|"Person: hey you have a nice smile
Me: eh thanks, it's fake."

mysteryscars|Day 7. Feeling confident with yourself around guys because you are skinny and guys only like skinny.
mysteryscars|I just want to get drunk with someone right now, watch the stars and talk about all the problems we have going on.
mysteryscars|You almost convinced me that I mattered.

mysteryscars|I always make the same mistakes.
mysteryscars|Day 6. Tracing your fingers across your ribs and being able to feel every bone.
mysteryscars|There’s nothing worse than regretting the fact you told someone too much about yourself and your secrets.
mysteryscars|Day 5. Taking cute photos with friends in bikinis.
mysteryscars|I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking.
mysteryscars|It's so humiliating when you talk so highly about someone who is talking so low of you.
mysteryscars|Never get too attached to someone, because attachments lead to expectations and expectations lead to disappointments.
mysteryscars|It shouldn't be selfish to do what's best for you.
mysteryscars|I once had a best friend that's now a stranger.
mysteryscars|She smiles when it hurts and she laughs when it kills.
mysteryscars|I wonder if I'm on your mind as much as you're on mine.
mysteryscars|I don't give up on people, they give up on me. So trust me when I tell you I'm not going anywhere.
mysteryscars|Text me first, I like that shit.
mysteryscars|I envision our future, when we don't even have a present.
mysteryscars|It would've already happened if he really wanted it to.
mysteryscars|You've been gone for ages but the pain's still here.
mysteryscars|Somehow I always knew I wasn't good enough for you.
mysteryscars|There is nothing as dangerous as false, lingering hope.
mysteryscars|I couldn't stop loving you, and you couldn't stop loving her.
mysteryscars|Every time I get a text I still hope it's from you.
mysteryscars|I have to ask, did I ever really matter to you?
mysteryscars|You are the longest passenger on my train of thought.

mysteryscars|I miss my best friend more than anything but she doesn't miss me at all.
mysteryscars|Don't force yourself to love someone just because you're lonely.
mysteryscars|It's like the emptiness inside me is trying to expand.
mysteryscars|You said you were there for me but you never asked if I was okay when it was obvious I was struggling.
mysteryscars|Why couldn't I just fucking say I'm not okay?
mysteryscars|How is it that you'll never notice that you were slowly killing me?
mysteryscars|All alone I watch you watch her like she's the only girl you've ever seen.
mysteryscars|Don't make people feel guilty for something that they can't control.

mysteryscars|"Depression: Eat all the food and take a nap.
Anorexia: Don’t eat for the next 72 hours and work out daily."
mysteryscars|I used to be happy but then I looked in the mirror.
mysteryscars|I wonder if you know how it really feels to be left outside alone.
mysteryscars|There's not much more to say.
mysteryscars|All my life I've been waiting.
mysteryscars|Wish we could turn back time to the good old days.
mysteryscars|Day 4. Not feeling guilty after eating.
mysteryscars|Day 3. Not feeling like everyone is staring you, laughing at you, judging you because of your fat.

mysteryscars|@thiniswhoiam @lightlyfloating Mine is December 5th too!! omg omg
mysteryscars|Why do we constantly feel the need to tell everyone everything.
mysteryscars|Every now and then keep that good news to yourself.
mysteryscars|I’m lost and it kills me inside.
mysteryscars|I’m in a box but I’m the one that locked me in it.
mysteryscars|I’m paralysed. I’m scared to live but I’m scared to die.
mysteryscars|I’m always prepared for goodbyes because that’s all I’ve ever known.
mysteryscars|I am okay with not being okay. I deserve what I'm getting. I deserve to be unstable. I deserve to be unhappy.
mysteryscars|It's so obvious that no one likes me. I'm always the one putting in the effort, making the plans, and keeping in touch.
mysteryscars|All I am to everyone is a burden.
mysteryscars|@i_am_a_human666 It's not that simple. I wish it was. I know it seems as if I could just leave my 'friends' but I cant.
mysteryscars|I always think my friends are mad at me or are talking about me or hate me. Oh wait they are.
mysteryscars|@InternallyIost Preaaccchhh
mysteryscars|Friends who defend you when you are not around are so important.
mysteryscars|Don't lie to 'protect' my feelings.
mysteryscars|@Vulnerable But the trouble is how do you make them stay?
mysteryscars|It's kinda weird how you can think about someone so much and they would have no idea.
mysteryscars|I don't even feel like a 'friend' to some people. I feel more like a second option or someone they run to when they need something.
mysteryscars|I'm LITERALLY killing myself for acceptance.
mysteryscars|Honestly people only talk to me when they want something or have no one else to talk to.
mysteryscars|I was myself today. I acted the same way that I would with my closest friends in front of everyone. And I didn't care. It felt great.
mysteryscars|My biggest fear and problem that I am currently dealing with: exclusion.
mysteryscars|I have had an ed for over 2 years now and I still haven't lost any weight. How sad is that.
mysteryscars|We were never meant for each other. But I'm glad that even in a sheer moment it felt like we were.
mysteryscars|I keep having to remind myself that if you wanted to talk or be with me, you would.
mysteryscars|You've taught me a lot about love, even if you could not give it to me.
mysteryscars|Nothing sucks more than being unsure whether someone enjoys your company or not.
mysteryscars|I don't want control, I want to let go.
mysteryscars|Nothing hurts more than being ignored, excluded, replaced or forgotten.
mysteryscars|Bestfriends make life so much better, too bad I don't have any.
mysteryscars|When people ask if I'm friends with a person I say idk bc I'm scared that if they ask that person the same question abt me they'll say no.
mysteryscars|You never know what you have until it becomes 'had'.

mysteryscars|The hardest part is waking up in the morning and remembering what you were trying to forget the night before.
mysteryscars|Open up to me and straight away I will fall deeply in love with you.
mysteryscars|In a world where everyone wears a mask, it's a privilege to see a soul.
mysteryscars|How do you know if you actually love someone or just deeply like them?
mysteryscars|I always notice how the slightest change in how someone talks or acts towards me can change my entire mood.
mysteryscars|People think eds are all about hating your body but honestly in the end it's mostly about hating all of yourself, both in and out.
mysteryscars|Be empathetic not sympathetic.
mysteryscars|You'll never really understand it until it happens to you.
mysteryscars|That awkward moment when someone asks u if u have twitter and then they ask for ur username but u can't tell them bc ur acc is all about ed.

mysteryscars|If only you noticed the way I look at you.
mysteryscars|I hate when people laugh or disagree with me when I say that I have no time to spare. Like I'm literally preoccupied 24/7 with slowly dying.
mysteryscars|My time isn't valueable, I'm not valueable.

mysteryscars|The worst type of crying is the silent one. When you can't breathe and everything is crashing down but you can't do anything to stop it.
mysteryscars|I want you. I want us.
mysteryscars|I don't know why but I always trigger myself and make myself really bad.
mysteryscars|When someone tells me I look familiar, I always start to panic.
mysteryscars|If I killed myself would you finally care?
mysteryscars|I'm actually so afraid that no one will ever love me.
mysteryscars|I always have these scenarios in my head that I wish would happen, but never will happen and I feel so bad...
mysteryscars|No one ever likes me as much as I like them. Maybe that's my problem.
mysteryscars|I miss you but you seem completely fine without me...
mysteryscars|Where do you go when home isn't home.
mysteryscars|I either eat too much or starve myself. Oversleep or have insomniac nights. Fall in love or hate passionately. I don't know what grey is.
mysteryscars|I'm sorry for being annoying when I need to talk, needy cause I miss you, emotional when I care and insecure when I'm afraid to lose you.
mysteryscars|I notice everything but don't say anything.
mysteryscars|Friends can break your heart too.
mysteryscars|I get jealous because I know how easily replaceable I am. I know I'm no one special.
mysteryscars|We always ignore those who adore us and adore those who ignore us.
mysteryscars|I want to be the one you choose when everyone wants you.
mysteryscars|The scariest thing about distance is that you don't know whether they will miss you or forget you..
mysteryscars|no one texts me but i'm always on my phone.
mysteryscars|Can the old 'us' come back please?
mysteryscars|i don't think i've ever shown someone my entire truth, i've always lied about or distorted what i thought or felt about something.
mysteryscars|"*starves all day, binges all night.
End Result: gains weight."
mysteryscars|People only care about you when it's convenient for them.
mysteryscars|I hate getting flashbacks from things you don't want to remember. Your heart suddenly drops and the anxiety starts taking over.
mysteryscars|People who understand my sense of humour automatically become my favourite people.
mysteryscars|you hate me? well i hate myself too.
mysteryscars|I wish I was someone's favourite person.
mysteryscars|saying i'm tired when you're actually sad.
mysteryscars|I hate when people act like they care but they really don't.
mysteryscars|I notice everything but don't say anything.
mysteryscars|I prefer the jealous type, at least i then know you care.
mysteryscars|I want a relationship where we just chill at each other's houses.
mysteryscars|you miss me but you're not doing anything about it? Yeah, sure, sounds convincing.
mysteryscars|it's so embarrassing when you talk so highly about someone or something that ends up disappointing you.
mysteryscars|I hate when you want to talk about something but you feel like you've already talked about it too much so you just hold it in.
mysteryscars|i hold on to things and people when i know they won't come back.
mysteryscars|Stuck somewhere between try harder and why bother.
mysteryscars|I don't have a sense of humour anymore. It's literally just sarcasm and a general hate for the majority of the human population.
mysteryscars|Have you ever noticed that people will say how much they'll be there for you, but when the time comes they never are.
mysteryscars|I wish i meant a little more to you.
mysteryscars|Our small, stupid conversations mean more to me then you will ever understand.
mysteryscars|"Do you ever write a really long message to someone but halfway through you're like ""you know what, they don't care"" and end up deleting it."
mysteryscars|I would way rather be scary skinny than average weight.
mysteryscars|Just remember, I cared when no one else did.
mysteryscars|'texting' and 'talking' are not the same thing.
mysteryscars|we put on a fake smile to hide the pain we feel, yet we wish someone would look closely enough and see how broken we really are inside.
mysteryscars|We could sit in a car for 2 hours and talk about our lives, that's a date right there.
mysteryscars|I wanted to text you but then i remembered that we don't talk anymore.
mysteryscars|I'm in the mood for a late night conversation, some deep talks, to have some feelings poured out, and to feel better again.
mysteryscars|I don't understand why I care so much when you don't care at all.
mysteryscars|I like when texting someone becomes a routine, like it's weird if you don't text them all day.
mysteryscars|Stop telling people that they have to love their parents. Parents can be toxic and abusive, being a parent doesn't change that.
mysteryscars|maybe they'll like me when I'm thin.
mysteryscars|"I skipped a meal
but nobody noticed
because I'm not underweight."
mysteryscars|do you ever zone out, and you're aware that you zoned out, but you're just too lazy to zone back in.
mysteryscars|Sorry my suffering isn't as good as your suffering.
mysteryscars|"*something bad happens.
Me: it's probably because i'm fat."
mysteryscars|everyday i wonder where i went so wrong.
mysteryscars|dragging a blade across my wrist makes me feel so much calmer.
mysteryscars|those teenagers who sit in their rooms at night &amp; cry themselves to sleep were once children with light in their eyes &amp; hope in their heart.
mysteryscars|I love seeing your name pop up on my phone.
mysteryscars|"The worst thing is

when you don't eat

and feel skinny

but then you look in the mirror

and you're still as fat as ever."
mysteryscars|once you've been hurt, you get scared to get attached again because you're always thinking everyone you love will always end up hurting you.
mysteryscars|that awkward moment when you think you're important to someone, but you're not.
mysteryscars|she loves hard because she knows how it feels to be loved so little.
mysteryscars|One day you'll realise how much i cared.
mysteryscars|I text you first everyday. But today I won't. Today, I want you to text me first. Today, I want you to miss me.
mysteryscars|i wonder if you ever talk about missing me.
mysteryscars|3 types of mad: when i'm so mad that i cry, when i'm mad and i just snap, and when i'm mad and i just don't want to talk to anybody.
mysteryscars|I caught myself smiling for no reason, then I realised that I was thinking of you.
mysteryscars|i truly hate every inch of myself...
mysteryscars|Never get too attached to something that isn't yours.
mysteryscars|My day can easily be made by one text from you.
mysteryscars|Don't tell me that my depression isn't real when I'm an A student who failed every exam last semester because i couldn't get out of bed.
mysteryscars|Nothing like being called worthless by the person in place of my father to make me feel even more shit.
mysteryscars|i wish i was one of those naturally skinny and pretty girls.
mysteryscars|overthinking always ruins my mood.
mysteryscars|*tries to make depression and self hatred better by starving.
mysteryscars|if someone really wants to see you, they'll find a reason, they'll find a way, and they'll make an effort.
mysteryscars|my weight is unacceptable.
mysteryscars|I could actually be pretty if i was skinny.
mysteryscars|Do you ever look at someone and you're like how?!
mysteryscars|it terrifies me how i can love you so much even though you are destroying me.
mysteryscars|I want to sit on a rooftop with someone at 3am, staring at the stars and talking about all of the problems that we have going on.
mysteryscars|i hate being second to those i put first.
mysteryscars|nobody wants me.
mysteryscars|note to self: nobody actually cares.
mysteryscars|the saddest moment is when the person who you shared memories with becomes the memory.
mysteryscars|But all i said was, I'm okay. And the sad thing was that you believed me.
mysteryscars|You asked me how i was doing and i wanted to spill out all of my pain to you. I wanted to say, i'm really not doing well at all.
mysteryscars|i wonder how it feels to be happy with your own body.
mysteryscars|"My biggest problem is that i always say ""just this once won't hurt..."" but this once turns into every weekend, every day, every hour."
mysteryscars|"""What happened to the old you?""
broken, dead and gone."
mysteryscars|Those moments where the depression just suddenly hits you and you're unable to even more. You just feel completely empty.
mysteryscars|I wonder if i'm on your mind as much as you're on mine.
mysteryscars|"i want all my secrets back.
i don't want anyone to know anything about me."
mysteryscars|i honestly feel more like an option or backup plan to most people rather than an actual friend.
mysteryscars|"I say ""what the fuck is wrong with you"" to myself a billion times a day."
mysteryscars|everyone has a chapter that will always remain unspoken.
mysteryscars|you broke me and I apologised.
mysteryscars|you don't understand depression until you can't stand you own presence in an empty room.
mysteryscars|i really wish i had the courage to kill myself and end it.
mysteryscars|sometimes i honestly believe that i'm just not made for friendships and relationships.
mysteryscars|I want to be so thin that everyone will worry about me when they see me.
mysteryscars|I miss how close we used to be.
mysteryscars|tbh i like clingy.
mysteryscars|I want to slit my fucking wrists.
mysteryscars|"Them: You'll gain all of the weight back once you stop.
My Thoughts: You don't understand. I never plan on stopping."
mysteryscars|I want his attention but when he gives me it I get scared and anxious. Like what the actual fuck is wrong with me?
mysteryscars|It sucks trying to explain to someone that you have an eating disorder when you don't look like it.
mysteryscars|When I take a bath I like putting my head under water. It kind of feels like I'm dying for a minute.
mysteryscars|don't you realise that my constant 'jokes' about killing myself aren't actually jokes at all.
mysteryscars|music over people.
mysteryscars|I want someone to feel lucky to have me.
mysteryscars|nothing hurts more than watching someone so important to you not caring about you at all.
mysteryscars|If i reply in under a minute, you're hella important to me.
mysteryscars|I'm not anorexic, I'm not bulimic, I'm not a binge eater. I switch from starve, binge, purge, eat normal, binge, try to 'recover', repeat.
mysteryscars|why can't i socialize like a normal person, why do i have to be so fucking anxious all the time.
mysteryscars|It honestly scares me sm that you don't really know what a person really feels about you, like everything could just be one massive lie.
mysteryscars|it sucks when you decide not to talk to someone for a while and they don't even seem to notice or miss you.
mysteryscars|"The weight will drop.

Just fucking watch me."
mysteryscars|I like when you reply fast.
mysteryscars|Can't you tell i'm trying?
mysteryscars|I want to be the person that you are scared to lose.
mysteryscars|It sucks being the person that always cares more.
mysteryscars|I want to be your addiction.
mysteryscars|always apologising for being me. for laughing too hard, loving too deeply, speaking too passionately. i'm done.
mysteryscars|Caught between feeling sad and feeling nothing at all.
mysteryscars|i wish i knew what people really thought of me.
mysteryscars|Eating disorders are so weird. Like i can manage to eat a whole packet of chips but i can't eat an apple? The actual fuck.
mysteryscars|i promise to make myself so perfect that everyone will regret ever ignoring me, rejecting me and hurting me.
mysteryscars|i wish i was a girl that thought i was fat but is actually skinny, but no i'm a girl that thinks she's fat and is actually fat.
mysteryscars|i don't think people really understand how serious i am when i say that i hate myself, my body and my personality. i am dead serious.
mysteryscars|my body makes me angry, sad, disappointed, ashamed, vulnerable and motivated all at the same time. how ?!
mysteryscars|I don't have a valid eating disorder.
mysteryscars|I'm actually so in love with a guy that likes my bestfriend.
mysteryscars|Someone help. I just cut and the skin has gone like dark purple/blue! It's never done that before. What's happening?
mysteryscars|"I wonder,
How many cuts,
Or 'accidents',
Or breakdowns,
Or panic attacks,
Or 'tired' days,
It will take for someone to actually notice."
mysteryscars|I'm not sure if i'm crying tears of happiness or sadness right now, i just feel everything all at once and it's really confusing.
mysteryscars|I just want to be perfect, is that to much to ask for?
mysteryscars|I'm scared of not being enough. not pretty enough, not skinny enough, not smart enough, not funny enough, not happy enough, not good enough.
mysteryscars|wish someone would stay up late at night just to talk to me.
mysteryscars|I'm a slut.
mysteryscars|There's always that one person that you have had feelings for since the day you met them.
mysteryscars|Do you ever miss someone that hasn't actually left you yet but you can feel them drifting away?
mysteryscars|I want to be the person that you are addicted to, constantly text and think of before you go to sleep and wake up.
mysteryscars|I have an irrational fear of missing out on things because I'm so insecure that I'm not good enough.
mysteryscars|I'm a little unsteady.
mysteryscars|One text from you can change my mood like crazy.
mysteryscars|I feel confident right now because I haven't eaten. I wish I could feel like this always.
mysteryscars|I've been holding back for the fear that you might change you mind.
mysteryscars|Little do you know how I'm breaking while you fall asleep.
mysteryscars|Please don't just leave a conversation. If you need to go tell me, don't randomly disappear and leave me wondering if I did something wrong.
mysteryscars|please dont encourage me to eat. i dont want food, i dont want you to want me to want food. ill be strong, let me be strong.
mysteryscars|why can't i have a good body. like that is literally all i want in the world.
mysteryscars|how could i ever expect you to like me when i'm this fucking fat.
mysteryscars|i hate myself sm rn. i feel like if my body was skinny then maybe i could love myself a bit more.
mysteryscars|Self Control - 0%
mysteryscars|i think i might like you.
mysteryscars|i think i'm going to write my suicide letters now.
mysteryscars|im so sorry.
mysteryscars|always tired but never of you.
mysteryscars|why do i allow myself to eat when i know how much i will regret it and hate myself after.
mysteryscars|i hate how since hate myself sm i can never believe &amp; accept when others say that they like me because i just dont understand whats to like.
mysteryscars|so paranoid when it comes to my friendships.
mysteryscars|ugh i hate myself sm.
mysteryscars|sometimes i wish someone would just care enough to see how much i am really suffering.
mysteryscars|i ate so much today. kill me please. i dont deserve to live.
mysteryscars|cause once upon a time you were my everything.
mysteryscars|i don't have a personality.
mysteryscars|"they say: ""no pressure"" and ""don't worry about it, it's fine""
me: ""oh my god they hate me"", ""shit i'm so sorry that i exist""."
mysteryscars|why can't i be loved, wanted and appreciated like all the other girls.
mysteryscars|does anyone else have days where they just want to quit and give up everything?
mysteryscars|too much stuff going on recently. my mind is too overcrowded that it hurts.
mysteryscars|all my smiles these day are fake and broken.
mysteryscars|everyone loves my friend, i feel like i should be happy for her but i just can't help but feel worthless.
mysteryscars|@thunderxthights good on you x so proud 💕 stay strong beautiful !
mysteryscars|even when im surrounded by others i still feel alone.
mysteryscars|starting to believe that i only have one friend that actually only stays with me though out of pity.
mysteryscars|"i hate my ""friends""."
mysteryscars|not motivated at all.
mysteryscars|don't ignore the people who have always been there for you and care about you the most. just dont.
mysteryscars|i always go back to the people that hurt me the most.
mysteryscars|i just want to be skinny. i legit dont care about anything else in this god damn fucking world except for being skinny.
mysteryscars|would you love me if i was skinny and beautiful like her?
mysteryscars|when will a guy that i like finally text me first?
mysteryscars|i think about hurting u the way u hurt me so you can understand how i feel but then i remember that i care too much and u dont care at all.
mysteryscars|People say that I'm not really depressed or anxious but how would they know when they have no idea about what I'm feeling.
mysteryscars|The thoughts used to only hit me at night. Now I get them all the time 24/7.
mysteryscars|I need self control
mysteryscars|please just be honest with me.
mysteryscars|it always feels like i'm alone.
mysteryscars|it really hurts
mysteryscars|I hate how I can be almost fine for a few days and then all of a sudden I'm not anymore.
mysteryscars|I just want to fit in, to belong. Is that so much to ask?
mysteryscars|@BrxkenPosts dm now?
mysteryscars|Always going to be second choice to those who i put first.
mysteryscars|FAT FAT FAT FAT FAT FAT FAT
mysteryscars|The worst feeling in the world is being alone when your surrounded by others.
mysteryscars|All I want is to belong.
mysteryscars|The anxiety when u sent someone a text that you were unsure about sending, and they haven't opened it yet so you are just anxiously waiting.
mysteryscars|Always making the same mistakes over and over again, yet never learning from them.
mysteryscars|I always regret telling people about myself and my problems.
mysteryscars|"Me: why am I so fat. I hate myself.
Also Me: eats and eats and eats, and has no control to stop."
mysteryscars|no one notices because tbh no one cares.
mysteryscars|I just want to be able to shut everything out.
mysteryscars|no one else notices but me, I look into his eyes I can tell. He's hurting too.
mysteryscars|@RohmDawgg add me back so I can direct message you.
mysteryscars|I just want to be someone's first choice for once.
mysteryscars|i'm never thin enough, pretty enough or even good enough.
mysteryscars|Sad from losing people who weren't even really mine to begin with.
mysteryscars|Sometimes i make myself continue crying because I know that once I stop feeling sad I won't feel anything at all. And I don't want that.
mysteryscars|I hate when I take 3 seconds to reply to someone and they take like 3 billion years to reply back.
mysteryscars|i'm always the one left behind wondering what the hell I did wrong.
mysteryscars|I wish I had someone that I could lie in bed and cuddle with forever and have deep conversations at 3am in the morning.
mysteryscars|I just want to be able to look myself in the mirror and not be ashamed.
mysteryscars|I just want to be the first person you think of when you wake up and the last person you think of when your falling asleep.
mysteryscars|why is it so hard to find someone that loves me as much as I love them.
mysteryscars|I hate being alone.
mysteryscars|I hate how my social anxiety stops me from being myself and being able to talk to other people without stressing.

lm_Depressed|Can nobody see that I'm surrounded by people but completely alone inside?
lm_Depressed|Sadness is an everyday feeling but anguish and sorrow are things that no one should experience.
lm_Depressed|It's getting worse than ever
lm_Depressed|Mood: Alone
lm_Depressed|Now I know what it is to feel really alone
lm_Depressed|Happiness is overrated anyway
lm_Depressed|No wonder I have trust issues when the people I would take a bullet for are the ones who pulled the trigger.
lm_Depressed|Smile through the hurt, laugh through the pain, make jokes through the suicidal thoughts
lm_Depressed|@pxpi_michey They are feelings I know too well.
lm_Depressed|I can feel my heart beat in my chest, and more than ever I wish it would stop.
lm_Depressed|https://t.co/HCX2I2vtq8
lm_Depressed|I hate myself so much.
lm_Depressed|It's okay. I wouldn't want to be my friend either.
lm_Depressed|I just want to cry until my eyes are dry and I want to bleed until I am void of life.
lm_Depressed|When people ask how you are, they don't really want to know.
lm_Depressed|@pxpi_michey I just type what I'm to afraid to speak.
lm_Depressed|Help me, Help me, Help me, Help me, Help me, Help me, Help me GODDAMMIT JUST HEAR ME.
lm_Depressed|It seems everyone in this world is deaf, or maybe they choose to ignore my screams for help.
lm_Depressed|My sleeves may not be long, but you will never see me in shorts.
lm_Depressed|I'm an open book, anyone could read me if they got a little closer and flipped the page, but who likes reading anyway?
lm_Depressed|I don't even have real friends
lm_Depressed|My smile is a distraction for my pain. The happiness in my eyes is a coverup for the tears.
lm_Depressed|Everyone thinks I'm the happy girl. Everyone thinks I'm the funny girl. Nobody thinks I'm the pretty one. Nobody thinks I'm the one in pain.
lm_Depressed|I'm the girl who wants to jump. I'm the girl who wants it to be over. I'm the girl who is always second best.
lm_Depressed|I'm the girl who everyone thinks is emo. I'm the girl who's worst enemy is her head. I'm the girl who's thoughts drive her to hurt.
lm_Depressed|I'm the girl with the broken smile. I'm the girl with the sad eyes. I'm the girl with the long pants and sleeves on a 90 degree day.
lm_Depressed|I know one day all the anger, all the sadness, every emotion that I've ever bottled up is going to make me snap
lm_Depressed|I want to be free I want to feel free
lm_Depressed|I just wanna leave this shitty town and never look back
lm_Depressed|Does it get better? Does the pain ever end?
lm_Depressed|I'm tired. I'm tired of this world we live in. Tired of body images. Tired of being depressed. I'm just tired of everything
lm_Depressed|Cut 1 because I'm worthless Cut 2 because I hate myself Cut 3 because everybody else hates me. All the rest because I deserve the pain
lm_Depressed|"""Why would anyone cut? Doesn't it hurt"" I would rather feel pain then nothing at all, but I don't expect you to understand. No one does."
lm_Depressed|What is the point? Wake up, work, sleep, repeat until the end of our existence.
lm_Depressed|I want to be in a relationship but I know I'm to mentally and emotionally unstable.
lm_Depressed|"""Why do you cut, it's stupid"" ""I don't get it"" of course you don't you'll never understand until it's you."
lm_Depressed|🙁🔫
lm_Depressed|you're right i should focus on school instead of trying not to kill myself
lm_Depressed|if im not alone and people love me they certainly don't show it
lm_Depressed|just your average depressed bitch on the verge of killing herself
lm_Depressed|i don't know why i just dont kill myself already
lm_Depressed|waste of oxygen
lm_Depressed|i need something to distract my thoughts
lm_Depressed|i stand at the edge wishing someone would push me
lm_Depressed|i hate myself
lm_Depressed|i don't deserve life
lm_Depressed|im such a twisted person
lm_Depressed|i don't ever want to wake up
lm_Depressed|im dying to live. something's gotta give.
lm_Depressed|i feel alone in a crowd of peope. but when im alone my thoughts crowd me
lm_Depressed|My brain needs a vacation. So does my blade.
lm_Depressed|I gave into depression too easily. I can't help I'm weak.
lm_Depressed|I used to fight it, the depression, now I have just let it take me.
lm_Depressed|My happiness is only temporary.
lm_Depressed|I'm not happy... Im not sad... I'm just... Numb.
lm_Depressed|At first they were shallow. They get deeper every time.
lm_Depressed|Trying to coax myself out of bed each morning is becoming harder than ever.
lm_Depressed|What to do when you don't know what to do.

BeyondBrokenDep|when you're actually feeling good for a moment because everything seems to be going okay and then something happens and boom sadness again.
BeyondBrokenDep|i'm going to smile like nothing is wrong, talk like everything is just pefrect and act like i'm fine, and pretend like it's not hurting me.
BeyondBrokenDep|just because someone looks happy doesnt mean they are, because even a white rose has a black shadow..
BeyondBrokenDep|I keep my feelings to myself because it's hard for someone eles to understand them.
BeyondBrokenDep|Sometimes we don't need advice. We just need somebody to listen!
BeyondBrokenDep|sometimes, when you cry so much that you just can't cry anymore. your eyes didn't dry out, your heart just kinda stopped feeling everything.
BeyondBrokenDep|the strongest people are the ones who feel like they’re dying inside but still roll out of bed get dressed, and can actually leave the house
BeyondBrokenDep|I'm not afraid to love, I'm afraid of not being loved back.
BeyondBrokenDep|Depression isn't something you choose. Depression chooses you. And it doesn't care who you are!
BeyondBrokenDep|It's sad how others can see people struggling and breaking down yet don't do anything to help them. Instead calling them attention seekers.
BeyondBrokenDep|"I really hate that ""not good enough"" feeling."
BeyondBrokenDep|There come's a point where you just dont care anymore. I'm there.
BeyondBrokenDep|Some of us are just trying to get through the day, without falling apart.
BeyondBrokenDep|Im sick of fighting for someone, who won't fight for me?
BeyondBrokenDep|every time i get close to someone, they let me down. and each time it gets harder to pretend i don't care.
BeyondBrokenDep|I miss you, but I know you don't care.
BeyondBrokenDep|it’s sad how mental illnesses can be more destructive than physical illnesses, yet they're treated like nothing until something bad happens.
BeyondBrokenDep|they say don't ever give up on the people you love, but what do you do when every person that you've ever loved gives up on you?
BeyondBrokenDep|I'm tired of getting lied to, tired of being used, tired of fake people, tired of pleasing people, tired of judgmental people. Just tired.
BeyondBrokenDep|Have you ever been so sad you can feel it making you physically sick?
BeyondBrokenDep|this tweet goes to anyone thats had suicidal thoughts in their life time i'm glad you're still here. i know it's not easy to keep holding on
BeyondBrokenDep|do you ever feel physically sick because you know you're not good enough for anyone and can't do anything right, no matter how hard you try.
BeyondBrokenDep|Don't judge me for my choices when you don't understand my reasons!
BeyondBrokenDep|Pretending to be happy is physically and mentally exhausting.
BeyondBrokenDep|do you ever just sit there and realize that you mean nothing to anyone and, you start feeling lost, alone, and unloved, and truly unwanted.
BeyondBrokenDep|it sucks, doesn't it? Feeling like you're not good enough, no matter how hard you try.
BeyondBrokenDep|It's hard to act okay when everything seems so broken.
BeyondBrokenDep|i am constantly torn between wanting to fix myself and wanting to destroy myself.
BeyondBrokenDep|Sometimes, when you see a person cry it’s better not to ask why. Sometimes they just need a hug and letting them know you're there for them.

BeyondBrokenDep|It's hard to act okay when everything seems so broken.
BeyondBrokenDep|Instead of telling you how I feel, I sit on twitter and post tweets about it.
BeyondBrokenDep|i'm really sick of being me, i'm sick of trying my hardest and never ever being good enough..
BeyondBrokenDep|Today is a black day for me.
BeyondBrokenDep|depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die.
BeyondBrokenDep|Do you ever just sit there and realize that you mean nothing to anyone and you start feeling like shit and unwanted.
BeyondBrokenDep|Anything you say, no matter how little it is, can have a serious impact on someone's life!
BeyondBrokenDep|worst feeling in the world is knowing you did the best you could, and it still wasn't good enough.
BeyondBrokenDep|Nobody's perfect, we screw up, we make mistakes, have heartbreaks, go through hard times but you need to know that this is life.
BeyondBrokenDep|Have you ever been so sad that it physically hurts inside?
BeyondBrokenDep|do you ever fear rejection so much that you reject yourself for others before they can reject you?
BeyondBrokenDep|Always try to be strong enough to let go, and be smart enough to wait for what you deserve!
BeyondBrokenDep|So many tears coming from the girl who gave so many smiles.
BeyondBrokenDep|I guess my silence wasn't loud enough for you.
BeyondBrokenDep|Don't lower your standards, instead, wait for people to rise up to your expectations!
BeyondBrokenDep|all i really want is someone who won’t give up on me.
BeyondBrokenDep|Depression makes you numb, Anxiety makes you overthink everything. It's a vicious circle that never ever stops.
BeyondBrokenDep|Life is like the ocean. It can be calm and still or rough and rigid but in the end, it is always beautiful.
BeyondBrokenDep|i'm truly sorry i get sad over nothing i'm sorry i feel everything at once i'm really sorry i'm so screwed up i'm sorry i mess everything up
BeyondBrokenDep|Sometimes the only thing that people see is what you did when in fact they should be looking at why you did it.
BeyondBrokenDep|the worst thing about falling to pieces is that humans can do it so quietly.
BeyondBrokenDep|Overthinking kills your happiness, insecurities kills your self esteem, and lies kills your trust.
BeyondBrokenDep|One mistake, and everyone judges you!
BeyondBrokenDep|Don't get mad at yourself when you make mistakes, it's a chance for you to learn from them and grow.
BeyondBrokenDep|the loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.
BeyondBrokenDep|Guys to all you i'm talking via dm, i will have to make up a backup acc cos im going to hit dm limit i will follow… https://t.co/Kv4VVQD5wC
BeyondBrokenDep|i truly feel like everything i say or do is always wrong, like i'm a total disappointment to everyone, and all i ever do is let people down.
BeyondBrokenDep|Thanks to all the love and support ive recieved. Im stronger for it. If you need help, im back so im only a tweet or dm away. Love you all
BeyondBrokenDep|People cry, not because they are weak but because they have been strong for too long!
BeyondBrokenDep|The biggest mistake I've made in my life, is letting people stay in my life far longer than they deserve to.
BeyondBrokenDep|I need a break from my own thoughts.
BeyondBrokenDep|Never be ashamed of your story. It could inspire others.
BeyondBrokenDep|It's sad that some people arent waiting for their happy ending anymore. Theyre just waiting for the end.
BeyondBrokenDep|I know it's hard to believe, but you can beat your disorder, with the right help. I promise. You don't have to live with it forever.
BeyondBrokenDep|depression isn't always suicide notes and pill bottles. sometimes, it's all smiles and fake laughter depression isn't always easy to notice.
BeyondBrokenDep|My Anxiety is getting out of control!
BeyondBrokenDep|i hate getting flashbacks from things i don't want to remember.
BeyondBrokenDep|You can't break me anymore because i'm already broken.
BeyondBrokenDep|She didnt know who would leave or stay so she pushed them all away.
BeyondBrokenDep|Goodnight all. Please be kind to one another. Stay Safe n Stay Strong. Love you all&amp;lt;3
BeyondBrokenDep|Hope everyone is having a great Thursday&amp;lt;3
BeyondBrokenDep|People who can sense the sorrow behind your smile, the love behind your anger, the meaning behind your silence are your true friends.
BeyondBrokenDep|I just want someone to talk to late at night because that's when my thoughts hit me the most.
BeyondBrokenDep|Sometimes, when you see a person cry it’s better not to ask why. Sometimes they just need a hug and letting them know you're there for them.
BeyondBrokenDep|Hi guys took time of twitter, had a death in the family Thankyu 2 every1 who sent me loving n supportive tweets Im… https://t.co/tSfhM6CCxS
BeyondBrokenDep|I spend way to much time over analyzing, over thinking, and over reacting!
BeyondBrokenDep|i wish someone was afraid to lose me i'm always scared of losing people that i love but i doubt anyone would fight to keep me in their life.
BeyondBrokenDep|everybody has gone through something that has changed them in a way that they could never ever go back to the person they once were.
BeyondBrokenDep|Have you ever been so sad that it physically hurts inside?
BeyondBrokenDep|"do you ever write a really long message and about halfway through you're like ""you know what, they don't even care"" and end up deleting it."
BeyondBrokenDep|i always act like i'm fine and everyone thinks i'm okay, but when the lights are off and i'm all alone. that's when my tears start to fall.
BeyondBrokenDep|i hate when suddenly my anger turns into tears.

BeyondBrokenDep|Sadness can happen to anyone. Even the people who shouldn't be sad at all!
BeyondBrokenDep|Even the nicest people have their limits.
BeyondBrokenDep|It's sad how others can see people struggling and breaking down yet don't do anything to help them. Instead calling them attention seekers.
BeyondBrokenDep|A lot of people keep their feelings to themselves because they're tired of pouring their hearts out to the wrong person.
BeyondBrokenDep|wanting to start a conversation with someone,  but having the fear that you're bothering them..

BeyondBrokenDep|Be strong enough to stand alone, smart enough to know when you need help, and brave enough to ask for it.
BeyondBrokenDep|I lack motivation to do anything. I just want to hide under my covers and never come out.
BeyondBrokenDep|"Im not without flaws i don't try to be
I won't always be at my best &amp;amp;
often life gets the worst of me
But when… https://t.co/81F7ThAPuj"
BeyondBrokenDep|i don't think people really understand how hard it is to explain what's going on in your head, when you don't even understant it yourself.
BeyondBrokenDep|have you been so sad and want to be alone but at the same time you really wish there was someone who you could talk to that actually cares.
BeyondBrokenDep|It's not the song that makes you emotional, it's the people and things that come to your mind when you hear it.
BeyondBrokenDep|"""What's wrong?""
""I'm just tired.""
""Oh."" For once, I want to hear someone ask, ""Tired of what?"""
BeyondBrokenDep|you smile, but all you want is to cry. you talk, but you really just want to be quiet. you pretend like you're happy, but you really aren't.
BeyondBrokenDep|Wow love geting on twitter to see so mant loving and supportive mentions. You guy's are the best. Love you all&amp;lt;3
BeyondBrokenDep|Some people keep their feelings to themselves because they think no one will understand them or no one will care or scared of being rejected

BeyondBrokenDep|Damned if i do damed if i dont! All i want to do is help people now iv'e just made it worse!
BeyondBrokenDep|I will believe in you even if no one else does. Even if you don't believe in yourself!
BeyondBrokenDep|such a disappointment when you defend someone for so long thinking they are different and they turn out to be just like what everyone said.
BeyondBrokenDep|"Depression is a mental illness. It's not being lazy, and a person who suffers from depression can't ""just get over it"""
BeyondBrokenDep|i hate when suddenly my anger turns into tears.
BeyondBrokenDep|being sad for no reason is worse than being sad for a reason because there's nothing you can do to make yourself feel better.
BeyondBrokenDep|it hurts so much when you can feel yourself becoming less and less important to the person who means the most to you..
BeyondBrokenDep|Trust before you Love. Know before you Judge. Commit before you Promise. Forgive before you Forget. Appreciate before you Regret!
BeyondBrokenDep|I know I mess things up all the time, but I'm really trying hard not to.
BeyondBrokenDep|"i keep telling myself ""never ever again"" but i still find myself in the same situations feeling even worse than i did the first time around."
BeyondBrokenDep|I didn't walk away because I didn't care, I walked away because you didn't!
BeyondBrokenDep|no one notices your tears, no one notices your sadness, no one notices your pain. but they all notice your mistakes.
BeyondBrokenDep|Never get too attached to someone, because attachments lead to expectations and expectations lead to disappointments!
BeyondBrokenDep|It's really sad what someone could be going through, but you will never know because they always put a smile on!
BeyondBrokenDep|Never ignore a person who loves you and cares for you. One day, you may realize you've lost the moon while counting the stars.
BeyondBrokenDep|do you ever just sit there and realize that you mean nothing to anyone and, you start feeling lost, alone, and unloved, and truly unwanted.
BeyondBrokenDep|Be careful who you open up to. Only a few people actually care, the rest just want to have something to gossip about!
BeyondBrokenDep|I will never understand how someone can make you feel so worthless, when they know your not mentally well. And not even feel bad about it!
BeyondBrokenDep|"I really hate that ""not good enough"" feeling."
BeyondBrokenDep|Nobody's perfect, we screw up, we make mistakes, have heartbreaks, go through hard times but you need to know that this is life.

BeyondBrokenDep|A smiIe can mean a thousand words, but it can also hide a thousand problems!
BeyondBrokenDep|Don't make promises you have no intention of keeping!
BeyondBrokenDep|do you ever really want to talk to someone but you don't have the heart to do it because you feel like you'd just annoy them, or be rejected

BeyondBrokenDep|Everybody has gone through something that has changed them in a way that they could never go back to the person they once were!
BeyondBrokenDep|do you ever get in those really weird moods that you can't even explain what you're feeling it's like everythings mixed together all at once
BeyondBrokenDep|Have you ever started crying for one reason then end up crying about every possible thing wrong with your life!
BeyondBrokenDep|"Suicide isn't ""taking the easy way out"". Sometimes, it's the only choice people think they have. They need help, not criticism."
BeyondBrokenDep|Never be ashamed of your story. It could inspire others.
BeyondBrokenDep|she cries herself to sleep every night, wakes up the next day, puts make up on and a beautiful smile and tries to hide her unbearable pain.
BeyondBrokenDep|"i don't even feel like a ""friend"" to anyone. i really feel more like an option, or someone they only run to when they always want something."
BeyondBrokenDep|It's so ironic. Some people in life who say, 'I'm always going to be here for you.' are the ones that walk away first!
BeyondBrokenDep|I'm going to smile like nothing is wrong, talk like everything is perfect, act like i'm fine, and pretend like it's not hurting me.

BeyondBrokenDep|so this is what happens when you're too nice to people. they start to think that it's okay to treat you like shit.
BeyondBrokenDep|"""you've changed""

try going through what i've gone through and then see if you're the same. pain changes people it makes it harder to trust"
BeyondBrokenDep|I say sorry a lot because I secretly feel that everything is my fault.
BeyondBrokenDep|self harm is a illness not a phase or a choice. the amount of scars on the outside does not show the amount of suffering on the inside.

BeyondBrokenDep|i hate when you want to talk about something that bothers you but feel like you've already talked about it too much so you just hold it in.
BeyondBrokenDep|pain changes people, it makes them trust less, overthink more, and shut people out.
BeyondBrokenDep|some people are so emotionally drained that sleep doesn't do anything. You wake up tired. It doesn't go away.
BeyondBrokenDep|no one notices your tears, no one notices your sadness, no one notices your pain. but they all notice your mistakes.

BeyondBrokenDep|being sad for no reason is worse than being sad for a reason because there's absolutely nothing you can do to make yourself feel better.
BeyondBrokenDep|Pretending to be happy when you're in pain is just an example of how strong you are as a person.

There's no perfect timing
There's no happy ending"
DepressDiaries|I am and will never be good enough for anyone in this messed up world of ours
DepressDiaries|Pain is our past - today - and our future.
DepressDiaries|I don't dare to look into the mirror, so I turn around and look to my shaddow.
DepressDiaries|My confidence is just as fake as my smile
DepressDiaries|Sit back and watch me hurt...it's what you're good at
DepressDiaries|I specifically put in the rules what to do if I ever am not on a day or two so you all should of known what to do....
DepressDiaries|Okay, only 1 person sent me their points yesterday.....What's going on guys?
DepressDiaries|Saturday's Challenge is the exact same as Friday. Sunday is your rest day (still track your food &amp; water)
DepressDiaries|Saturday's Challenge is the same as Friday's! 😀
DepressDiaries|Friday Challenge https://t.co/3EpsJoqt1r
DepressDiaries|Guys, if you're sneaking into the Challenge I don't care. If you want to still join that's fine too. But u gotta let me know so it's fair!!
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker You're not doing the challenge? I thought you were!
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker Thank you!! I think our bodies can learn to be more at peace, we just have to find the right way to take care of them.
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker Except that's what I do every day lol
DepressDiaries|Wednesday Challenge https://t.co/7EswYhjX2m
DepressDiaries|Some of the Challenge has changed, mostly how you send me your information. Read this so you know!!! https://t.co/M2Rzs8sWr5
DepressDiaries|I forgot what today's challenge is 😂
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs You don't hide him in your dorm room  do you?? 😂
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs-- a slow transition that favors the first. I could tell you a bunch. But make sure its a kitten any older &amp; creates problems.
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs He's a but old but mine is almost 9 and I found it helps him exercise lol. I worried about the same thing but it's actually--
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs How old is he?
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs Omg get one!! My big guy has helped me through so much, he's probably the reason Im alive. My little one, well he's learning.
DepressDiaries|Unfortunately I do notice that sugar makes me feel worse. I say unfortunately because I love chocolate.
DepressDiaries|@limitlesslaura Ugh, isn't it the worst? I wish they sold self control on Amazon.
DepressDiaries|"For all of you who asked about depression &amp; sugar.
https://t.co/powSVE137U"
DepressDiaries|I love you all, don't ever forget that. So at all times there is someone who loves you, even if you don't believe it. 💜
DepressDiaries|If I could take all of ur pain &amp; give it to myself I would in a heartbeat. But this is ur battle &amp; someday you'll know why u fought so hard.
DepressDiaries|That doesn't mean they can't be happy. My dream is for all of you to find your happiness. And you will...just give it time.
DepressDiaries|"But the disease that alters the chemicals in your brain, no I don't believe it is possible for those people to ""recover."""
DepressDiaries|"Is it not a little negligent to promise recovery to everyone? The emotion experienced for a long time yes, people can ""recover."""
DepressDiaries|But with the correct help you learn ways to deal with it. Of course you can have an amazing life, but it's because you worked &amp; work hard.
DepressDiaries|I'm sorry but I believe if you have the mental illness depression you do not recover. You're brain doesn't magically fix itself.
DepressDiaries|@ProjSemicolon Then why are some of your tweets so ignorant? It's not a bad life it's a bad day? That's not what depression is at all.
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy Aww, thank you very much. That's just always been my goal. If you ever need anything I'm here for you. xoxo
DepressDiaries|@ProjSemicolon Does anyone who runs this account actually have depression or another mental illness?!?
DepressDiaries|This is so ignorant. It's not one bad fucking day. https://t.co/13VmJuQ85w
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy Everyone is different. This account has always been around to support people and show them they're not alone.
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy Congratulations on being able to stop. You should really be very proud of yourself.
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy But I can't make you understand that because you don't have a mental illness and know how that type of brain works.
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy Cutting is actually a coping mechanism that has kept many people alive.
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy -- is to make them realize they'll lose points &amp; possibly the challenge if they do. I'm actually promoting healthy behavior.
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy I can't fully explain it to you because you don't have an eating disorder. My goal with telling people not to purge or fast--
DepressDiaries|@anas_creation Believe me sweetheart, I know. If you need anything just DM me. xoxo
DepressDiaries|@anas_creation No fasting Missy!! And this a tweet, it's basically a binding legal document!!!
DepressDiaries|If you fast or purge during the challenge include it in your weekly update to me. You will lose 5 points. Please take it away from ur total.
DepressDiaries|@anas_creation Actually I better start deducting points for purging or fasting. Thanks for reminding me!!
DepressDiaries|@anas_creation @Nthn_Killjoy Hey, you guys might listen to my tweet 😂
DepressDiaries|BTW Fasting is not allowed in this challenge either!
DepressDiaries|Anyone else care to try and explain this better for me? https://t.co/Xbw4rWR90b
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy You don't understand, that actually helps people not the opposite like you think
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs Yes, but results are different for everyone. Also it's like 3 times a week and that just got tiring.
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs Yea, I'd just do ECT again
DepressDiaries|@depressedqueen_ Thank you!! I was really starting to think it was me.
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs I've done them all except having an implant put in my brain and trying ketamine which is still in the begging stages.
DepressDiaries|Seriously though, do their jeans run extremely small or is it just me???
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs Hopeless in the sense no medication or treatment will help me. I'm basically left up to experimental treatments.
DepressDiaries|Wtf is Hollisters jean problem???
DepressDiaries|@eating__probs Yes in some cases it can. I'm basically hopeless so my psychiatrist put me on a diet.
DepressDiaries|Fun Fact: I didn't take chocolate away just for fun. New studies show processed sugar can worsen depression.
DepressDiaries|@anas_creation Thank you!!! Love you 💜
DepressDiaries|Yes, this a game. The fact I'd rather kill myself than look like this means I get to go 2 times in a row.
DepressDiaries|@UnbreakableIzMe --You need to understand this helps them a hell of a lot more than it hurts them. I'd never hurt anyone one these people.
DepressDiaries|"@UnbreakableIzMe It's not a ""game."" I don't treat any illnesses as if they are. But you're on the outside. c---"
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy That comment wasn't related to everyday life. I'd never just say something like that.
DepressDiaries|Yes, this is also my regular account so I will not tweeting as usual. You may have to scroll through to find all the information.
DepressDiaries|If you have questions, concerns, etc. ASK!!! You're responsible for knowing the information!!
DepressDiaries|"As far as the Challenge is concerned 
Rules have been posted 
2 challenges &amp; 1 special challenge"
DepressDiaries|Tuesday Challenge https://t.co/pZyG6vDC58
DepressDiaries|There is a part of me that is missing and I can't figure out what it is.
DepressDiaries|With cuts on wrists &amp; tears running down her face, she wonders if she's beautiful now.
DepressDiaries|"I feel isolated from everyone and I’m out of control
I need someone like me just so I’m not on my own."
DepressDiaries|Maybe someday you'll actually see the sadness in her eyes and feel her pain as she cries at night.
DepressDiaries|I am taking control of my life, one cut at a time.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes it hurts more not to break the skin...
DepressDiaries|"And she whispers into the mirror as she wipes the tears from her blood-shot eyes, ""What did I do to deserve this??"""
DepressDiaries|"It's a cold world, full of cold places. 
Full of cold people, wearing two faces."
DepressDiaries|And shes the kind of girl that doesn't say much. But when she does - its means alot.
DepressDiaries|Hate, sadness, it's all the same to me misery lies within, you control whether you feel it or not.
DepressDiaries|@cookiechipzouis I know. I don't think I'll be able to do it lol
DepressDiaries|Please favorite that tweet so I know you saw it. And yes, it will fucking suck.
DepressDiaries|Challenge Surprise: Go from Tuesday- Saturday without weighing yourself! I understand how hard this may be for some of you. Worth- 10points
DepressDiaries|@alxndrblkv Why?
DepressDiaries|This week should be relatively easy. If you're having trouble with any of it please let me know.
DepressDiaries|@Nthn_Killjoy Until you have an eating disorder, you're not qualified to make a valid statement. #educate
DepressDiaries|Please Note: any food purged does not count as food consumed.
DepressDiaries|@cookiechipzouis It means I trust everyone to do the 3 things I asked of them without having to tell me yes or no.
DepressDiaries|@an0rexia_skinny You found it, you're signed up lovie!
DepressDiaries|@cookiechipzouis No, today everyone is on the honor system

DepressDiaries|@anas_creation For now just keep it to yourself.
DepressDiaries|Any problems/ questions just tweet or DM me.

DepressDiaries|Sorry everyone who is involved in the challenge. Turns out that flu never went away and decided to kick my ass.

DepressDiaries|So some asshole is dreaming all night and I get no sleep at all? Fail https://t.co/85TCWqFllA
DepressDiaries|If you understand what it feels like to hate ur body so much that ud  rather die then u are like me &amp; I won't let u down on this challenge.
DepressDiaries|If you recruit someone they must favorite the original tweet and then tweet me your name.
DepressDiaries|If you want to participate you must scroll through and favorite the original tweet!
DepressDiaries|Yessss, there will be prizes
DepressDiaries|#123Chal will possibly start early next week.
DepressDiaries|The challenge will be done on a point system. Recruit people for 1 point. You can have a maximum of 5 before it even begins.
DepressDiaries|I'll move it up, the first 15 people will be able to say what they want most included in the challenge.
DepressDiaries|And holidays usually mean pictures.....
DepressDiaries|Easter is in March this year too. That's another holiday guys!
DepressDiaries|The main goal is to get in shape but also by trying new things. It's mostly for fun and support!
DepressDiaries|@WORLDLESSELLA Thank you for forcing me to just make a general tweet 😊
DepressDiaries|The challenge will also get harder week by week.
DepressDiaries|This challenge will most likely have a par of everything, ex. cal count, work outs, water consumption, certain foods to eat and to avoid.
DepressDiaries|@WORLDLESSELLA Haven't fully decided but because it's so long probably everything will be included....
DepressDiaries|The name for this challenge will be #123Chal for the months of Jan. Feb. &amp; March. It's possible April will be added
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker Yea, they hate it &amp; most people think I'm crazy but they're not the ones paying my bills lol. And thank u so much ur so sweet!!
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker It's probably because we brush his teeth. My older cay had 2 teeth out, extremely expensive, so now we brush!
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker Oh I'm so sorry!!! I can't imagine life without either of them!
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker Have you noticed his gums being red or bleeding from getting his grown up teeth??
DepressDiaries|Obviously this is life so I can't make everyone happy but I will try!! xoxo
DepressDiaries|@SaraaAmiraa What's the 1 thing you want included in the challenge??💜
DepressDiaries|@Tacootori What's the 1 thing you want included in the challenge??💜
DepressDiaries|@hamour_ba7rani What's the 1 thing you want included in the challenge??💜

DepressDiaries|@worthlessxshit_ What's the 1 thing you want included in the challenge??💜
DepressDiaries|@cookiechipzouis What's the 1 thing you want included in the challenge??💜
DepressDiaries|The first 10 people signed up will get a say in what the challenge is!!!
DepressDiaries|Valentine's Day is coming up &amp; so is Spring Break, &amp; getting in shape is a lot better when you have a whole group of people supporting you!!
DepressDiaries|So far only 4 people are interested in a challenge so that's not going to work....
DepressDiaries|It won't be anything crazy restrictive.
DepressDiaries|Who wants to do something fun like a challenge or contest?? If you do favorite this tweet and send me some ideas! 💜
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker He'll be 6 months in like a week 😭 He's the craziest cat I've ever met though lol
DepressDiaries|Settle an argument between me &amp; my little: Do cough drops have calories? I say Yes, especially like berry flavor, she says No.
DepressDiaries|"Do you know what its like to be me?
To go through something not everyone can see??"
DepressDiaries|"My fault, my sin.
I quit, you win."
DepressDiaries|"You're the one who broke my heart
You're the reason my world fell apart
You're the one who made me cry
Yet I still love u &amp; I don't know why"
DepressDiaries|Counting on pain to keep you sane.
DepressDiaries|"Tell me I will be ok
I won't believe you
But I'll pretend to"
DepressDiaries|Secretly, i've never hated myself as much as I do now.
DepressDiaries|And just beacuse she breathes, it doesn't mean she's living.
DepressDiaries|Just close your eyes and pretend I'm the pretty girl you really want.
DepressDiaries|All I needed, was to be wanted, was that too much to ask?
DepressDiaries|Thankful for the darkness that numbed the pain in my heart and soul...
DepressDiaries|"If you saw
Inside,
My head,
You wouln't
Sleep at night.
Hell...
I can't even,
Sleep at night"
DepressDiaries|"Those who do not understand the dark fear it,
Those who embrace the dark fear nothing."
DepressDiaries|Don't worry about me, in the end I'll be fine, I'm just the girl forgotten, the girl left behind.
DepressDiaries|Oh great, this silly kitten followed me...or his brother gave him the boot...and now he thinks it's play time!
DepressDiaries|Every doctor has always told me not to stay in bed. So I guess I'll finally listen to one thing they say.
DepressDiaries|I dunno what the hell to do.
DepressDiaries|I can't lay awake in bed all night. It's torture.
DepressDiaries|I can't stand being this fat. I want to kill myself.
DepressDiaries|Why does it seem like it's to much to ask for someone to love me?
DepressDiaries|I don't fear life. . .I fear those who are in it. . .
DepressDiaries|Why can't we find the right words to say when we want to say something, but when we want to keep silent, the words just all spill out?
DepressDiaries|I can't go on, its all to much to take it
DepressDiaries|Nothing makes us so lonely as our secrets
DepressDiaries|"Staring in the mirror
Seeing nothing but shame
Tears streaming down her face,
Knowing that she's to blame.."
DepressDiaries|Stick and stones may scar my skin.. but words slice right through my soul within.
DepressDiaries|What you call pain...I call life
DepressDiaries|"The night hurts, because it makes the dark, darker
The daylight hurts, because it shows the reality"
DepressDiaries|"I try to escape this darkness within
But then I stumble, 
And my world starts to spin
Everything falls, and I tumble down"
DepressDiaries|Your words are careless yet they mean so much.
DepressDiaries|Why is this funny?? https://t.co/zQRSr1aYwS
DepressDiaries|If someone can look you in the eyes and lie to you, they will do anything to you.
DepressDiaries|I know I'm worthless because of you.
DepressDiaries|I'm constantly embarrassed or ashamed of things I say or do because of you.
DepressDiaries|I second guess everything I say and do because of you.
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker It's easier not to get well.
DepressDiaries|The pretty image I had of you is all shattered and broken now….should I take the time to fix it or is it just not worth it anymore?
DepressDiaries|I was always told to bite my tongue and give respect to those who dont even deserve it. But now I'm choking on my own blood.
DepressDiaries|The thing I want most is to smile and have it reach my eyes.
DepressDiaries|When will there be a smile on my face that isn't a lie?
DepressDiaries|Everything is changing, with false hope everything is broken
DepressDiaries|"After all these battles
After everything you've done
You'll finally see an angel
And she'll tell you that you've won"
DepressDiaries|Its not that I want to be a cutter, I just am. I can't change that, and I never will be able to.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes you have to realize, dreams get destroyed, hearts get ripped apart, and tears fall...
DepressDiaries|"Why do you think I'm worthless?
And why do I agree?
I am nothing to you
Because I am nothing to me"
DepressDiaries|Close my eyes at night, telling myself that I'm happy and ok.. But the nighttime tears know better..
DepressDiaries|"Give me a bottle,
I wanna get so drunk
I forget who I am"
DepressDiaries|Once again, I do not have time for the flu. I am fat and need to work out. Get with it body.
DepressDiaries|I bruise because I want to, I cut because I have to
DepressDiaries|"Dear Heart, 
Prepare to break and shatter. This is nothing new you have been broken before. To many times to even count anymore."
DepressDiaries|You dont know what its like, to be on the outside lookin in, feeling like theres something wrong, like you can never win
DepressDiaries|Life hates me...need i say more
DepressDiaries|What happens when the only thing you are living for gets taken away?
DepressDiaries|"Please don't ask to be strong today
This is my weakest hour 
My weakest thought 
I am leaving this dreadful life"
DepressDiaries|Cause I'm barely breathing and I can't find the air; i don't know who I'm kidding imagining you care
DepressDiaries|"I tear my heart open,
I sew myself shut,
My weakness is i care to much
My scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open to feel"
DepressDiaries|Just when you thought you'd lost everything, you find out you can lose a little more
DepressDiaries|Cutting is painless it's the tears that tear me apart
DepressDiaries|"In this world of torture,
I know that I am doomed.
I'm breaking down, I'm not ok,
Thats just what you assumed."
DepressDiaries|"Your hateful words stab me,
Like a knife in the heart.
You'll keep hurting me day after day,
Until you've torn me apart..."
DepressDiaries|The thoughts I once had are back, Everything feels wrong, I’m totally off track, its hard to be strong…
DepressDiaries|I've been trying to breath underwater too long...
DepressDiaries|I'm confused, and lost in my own thoughts. But it's not that I don't understand this world. It's that the world doesn't understand me.
DepressDiaries|"Do you know how it feels to be lost and confused? 
To look around and notice you're alone in this world..."
DepressDiaries|I walked away not to make you feel bad or to follow me; but so that I could suffer alone.
DepressDiaries|When I fall down, you're the one who remains by my side, But only to...Push me down even farther.
DepressDiaries|Ask me how many times my heart has been broken and I'll tell you to look at the sky and count the stars.
DepressDiaries|The scariest person is one that see's through the false smile and to the truth.
DepressDiaries|@Son0fAphrodite_ It's really hard to believe.
DepressDiaries|@yvonne_davidson I don't have the energy either. But I can't live with myself if I don't.
DepressDiaries|I don't want to let you go....but you're bringing me lower than I even bring myself....
DepressDiaries|@Son0fAphrodite_ Thank you, but I don't believe you. lol
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I realize that a light work out for me is the equivalent of a normal persons whole work out. It doesnt make me feel any better tho
DepressDiaries|I can't handle life and life can't handle me.
DepressDiaries|I'm nobody, just me... does that make me somebody?
DepressDiaries|https://t.co/dBiXtITbJd
DepressDiaries|Maybe I'm just unloveable.
DepressDiaries|Erasing the past only leads to rewriting the pain
DepressDiaries|Sometimes the day begins with nothing to look forward to and the day seems to end the way it began.
DepressDiaries|I may be the only girl who understands you but it does't mean I'm your soulmate. It means I experienced life.
DepressDiaries|We are all too young to have to feel like this..
DepressDiaries|Admitting you're hurt can be harder than being hurt.
DepressDiaries|The world keeps changing yet I stand still.
DepressDiaries|How did I ever get this broken?
DepressDiaries|I am not better than 'that'. I am 'that'.
DepressDiaries|I've come to terms with my numbness. It may stay as long as it doesn't kill my soul.
DepressDiaries|I wish I had a person to talk to, to calm me down, tell me that it's going to be ok, instead of going to the medicine cupboard &amp; taking pill
DepressDiaries|I hide my scars because you don't have the right to know the trick to life.
DepressDiaries|Why did I cut, you ask. Because it feels so damn good to feel alive.
DepressDiaries|I need someone to save me from all that I am
DepressDiaries|"You make yourself a bed
At the bottom of the blackest hole
And convince yourself thats the reason
You don't see the sun anymore"
DepressDiaries|"Broken on the inside,
Crying on the out
Always full of pain inside,
Always full of doubt..."
DepressDiaries|@Prettyinthin @lisarowe261 As far as I'm concerned I view some of you as family 😘
DepressDiaries|Maybe we settle because we don't believe anyone else could love us.
DepressDiaries|"Let the alcohol course through my veins,
Let it break my will and take the reins...
Alcohol is a dangerous heaven"
DepressDiaries|She's staring out the window and she's losing track of time. She's searching for a reason not to break down tonight.
DepressDiaries|How can you crave to be alone and yet alone is the only thing you ever feel.
DepressDiaries|It's not about whether or not life is worth the pain; But whether or not death is worth missing out on everything else.
DepressDiaries|There's just so much that time can't erase.
DepressDiaries|To be left behind... or to leave behind I wonder what hurts the most...
DepressDiaries|Her Own Thoughts Turned Against Her
DepressDiaries|Man, it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has. But Lord, it takes a lonely girl to wish that she had never dreamt at all.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes, you've got to get fcuked up to feel sober, cry to see clear. &amp; fall a hundred times to learn how to pick yourself back up again.
DepressDiaries|Life hates me.
DepressDiaries|You are my nameless scar inside.
DepressDiaries|I'm fading away, soon I'll be just a feeling, I'll be the cold breeze you feel, as you walk home late at night.
DepressDiaries|Do you enjoy lifting me up, just to watch me fall?
DepressDiaries|I am a wondering soul, that helps others from the shadows, never to be seen or remembered.
DepressDiaries|I hurt in places I'll never let you see.
DepressDiaries|The only time I can throw up is when there's nothing to actually throw up #failure
DepressDiaries|I looked in the mirror and I looked into my own eyes, and beyond my lens all I saw were broken pieces of my life.
DepressDiaries|Lost touch with life a while ago, I don't think I even want to come back.
DepressDiaries|From what dark dreams do the lost awake only to find the nightmare a reality...
DepressDiaries|After taking in so much sadness the only thing left to do is fake your smile so nobody will know how you really feel.
DepressDiaries|I finally faced my demons, and they told me, what I was too scared to know. I am Alone.
DepressDiaries|@Prettyinthin @lisarowe261 Hey you always have me. Don't forget I love you!
DepressDiaries|@anarexicED Well I have 4 inches on each side of my neck and another 3 on my foot. It's weird but surgery is just easier for me.
DepressDiaries|@anarexicED I'm sorry sweetie!! I hope you're okay and recover quickly! xoxo
DepressDiaries|I'd so much rather have surgery than a cold or the flu.
DepressDiaries|I don't have time for a cold, I need to work out.
DepressDiaries|Don't give your life to your lovers, they're bound to steal it away.
DepressDiaries|"I'm Too Weak To Smile,
Please, Help To Set Me Free,
I'm Too Scared To Be,
The Real Me."
DepressDiaries|It is easy to forgive others but extremely hard to forgive yourself for your mistakes that you deeply regret.
DepressDiaries|I wish I grew up in a house where I didn't have to walk on egg shells to avoid an argument.
DepressDiaries|Do you ever wonder why you're family is so surprised at the problems you have?? Who do they think did this to you??
DepressDiaries|Many of my issues of lacking self-confidence and happiness and motivation comes from you telling me that I can't do anything right.
DepressDiaries|While some can run from the pain, others must live through it.
DepressDiaries|I am nothing that brings happiness, I only dwell in darkness and bring pain to those I love.
DepressDiaries|"If you have never been seen,
There is no need to disappear."
DepressDiaries|The worst feeling is not death it is knowing you're not needed.
DepressDiaries|It's hard to live life when you have no real reason to.
DepressDiaries|It's like my dreams are slipping away through my fingers. It's like I don't even want them any more. But I do.
DepressDiaries|"Dying To Be Beautiful..
Starving For Your Attention..
Bleeding To Release This Hurt..
Is This What Life's Really About..??"
DepressDiaries|I have the heart of a desperate dreamer.
DepressDiaries|"Sleep tight broken angel...
For a dream is better then reality..."
DepressDiaries|My thighs are so fat I want to kill myself.
DepressDiaries|My kitty is 5 months old today. Stop growing up!!!!
DepressDiaries|I try hard to fit into this world but everyone in it keeps pushing me out.
DepressDiaries|"I try to stay strong and keep up this false pretense
But I've fallen so far no longer can it be my defense"
DepressDiaries|"Feelings I used to have arent there,
And for the first time in so long,
I really just don't care..."
DepressDiaries|"I look in the mirror
I see all the cuts
I have one thing to say about it
I deserve every f.u.c.k.i.n.g one."
DepressDiaries|"She begins to feel the pain
Of her father's rejection
She presses deeper in the vien
This is her only reflection"
DepressDiaries|When you're little you look up to your parents for right and wrong, what happens when they mess up your mind?
DepressDiaries|"I've changed my mind so much,
I can't even trust it.
My mind changed me so much,
I can't even trust myself."
DepressDiaries|"I wish someone would wipe these tears away,
My hands are drenched."
DepressDiaries|Just be yourself just be yourself that all I heard, yet the only one who excepts me is my corner.
DepressDiaries|You've beaten me down as much as possible, so I don't know if you'd be able to hurt me again.
DepressDiaries|They say you don't give up on family....
DepressDiaries|"Can You Remind Me Of A Time
When We Were, So Alive, 

Do You Remember That?"
DepressDiaries|Do you know what it feels like to have no one to talk to..when you need it at most?
DepressDiaries|I don't know what hurts more, getting hurt by your friends or getting hurt by your family..
DepressDiaries|You know that feeling where you just hate yourself so much it becomes physically painful?
DepressDiaries|I guess if I want to look semi-decent for Christmas I'm going to have to give up sleep.
DepressDiaries|The screaming in my head must be a sign I've held on too long.
DepressDiaries|How I wish you could see the real me that lies somewhere inside my skin.
DepressDiaries|They say with time it heals. But they were wrong. With time it makes it hurt so much more.
DepressDiaries|I forgot that pretending to be happy, won't actually make me happy.
DepressDiaries|Some people realize a little too late in the game that you can't run away from yourself.
DepressDiaries|Just when she finally figures out who she is, her world changes, and she has to restart from the beginning, and find herself again.
DepressDiaries|I dwell on the past because I see no future.
DepressDiaries|People shouldn't be so shocked by the cutting; they should be shocked by what causes it.
DepressDiaries|There's a whole other world outside of my window...My window's still nailed shut...
DepressDiaries|"All this anger I feel,
I can never reveal,
All this sadness I feel inside,
I must always hide."
DepressDiaries|"Tell them all to go to hell,
It's there fault this angel fell"
DepressDiaries|I spend all my time trying to fix what's wrong in my life instead of actually living it.
DepressDiaries|I'm to tired of all of this. Please just let it end.
DepressDiaries|@UnbreakableIzMe One of my nutrition books
DepressDiaries|@delicatefailure I love you. I've missed you so much! 💕
DepressDiaries|She's popping pills to chase the dreams...
DepressDiaries|Did you ever notice that the ones who do accept us still want us to change?
DepressDiaries|2 cups of water equals 1 pound on the scale
DepressDiaries|Exhausted, nauseous, blurry vision...still have to work out because I'm fat as hell.
DepressDiaries|Isn't it better to have scars on your arm than on your heart?
DepressDiaries|"Each new cut,
Covers an old scar.
Pain on top of pain,
Pain is what you are."
DepressDiaries|It's hard to know what's real when you're not.
DepressDiaries|I may not be perfect by your standards but I'm perfect at being a screw up.
DepressDiaries|"She's breaking up.
She's falling down.
She's crying for help.
Without a sound.."
DepressDiaries|Stop thinking you know me, when you don't.
DepressDiaries|"When I say that I don't care 
It's when I care the most."
DepressDiaries|The worst kind of alone is when you have tons of people around you who care but don't understand how you really feel...
DepressDiaries|It's kind of amazing really, how my own words do such a good job of destroying me.
DepressDiaries|The worst thing is knowing I'll survive.
DepressDiaries|Its not that I want to die, I just can't stand living with this pain.
DepressDiaries|I want to go back to believing in everything... And knowing nothing at all.
DepressDiaries|There is no love that I can see...even from the own hands that created me.
DepressDiaries|Put away the bathing suits for at least another month!!!!
DepressDiaries|Pain has become closer to me as any person ever will be.
DepressDiaries|"I've given my best,
I've got nothing left.
I can't do this on my own."
DepressDiaries|"Don't tell me its going to be okay.
Don't whisper words of encouragement. 
Just hold me until the pain fades."
DepressDiaries|Fade into the background. That's the only place you'll ever fit in.
DepressDiaries|I feel like I'm a million miles away from myself more and more these days.
DepressDiaries|I guess sleep is only for the pretty people.
DepressDiaries|You can't kick me down I'm already on the ground.
DepressDiaries|I can't do this on my own anymore. My strength is fading, and my mask is cracking and breaking.
DepressDiaries|"I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real."
DepressDiaries|"I took their smiles and made them mine
I sold my soul just to hide the light
And now I see what I really am,
A theif, a whore, a liar."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I look in the mirror and wish I could see nothing.
DepressDiaries|Being this fat is killing me. I can't do it anymore.
DepressDiaries|Please forgive me for not being pretty.
DepressDiaries|And I've never felt this pain any worse than the moment I looked up and noticed I've been alone this whole time.
DepressDiaries|I'd rather get hurt by your words than by your silence.
DepressDiaries|Its as if I haven't really woken up in weeks.
DepressDiaries|Love is knowing you don't deserve it.
DepressDiaries|Hating myself is exhausting.
DepressDiaries|@bitethecrave I miss you so much!!!! 💕💕
DepressDiaries|I don't understand why people feel the need to attack those with EDs. We didn't ask for this, why would we choose to live this way?
DepressDiaries|@_harditsingh So do I. The semicolon tattoo became a fad, that really pissed me off. We have nothing do they have to take our tattoo too?
DepressDiaries|The only problem with me is that I am the problem.
DepressDiaries|"I didn't want to admit it, it was easier to lie, 
And hide the hurt and emptiness, to smile instead of cry."
DepressDiaries|Has having depression &amp; anxiety become cool all the sudden? Because all these people on tv now have it when they didn't 6 months ago.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I forget. So thank you for being there to remind me of exactly how worthless I am.
DepressDiaries|I don't know what my kitten is doped up on but I want some because he's having a fucking fabulous time.
DepressDiaries|Am I the only person who wonders if like DayQuil and NightQuil have calories in them??
DepressDiaries|"Don't Try to Save Me 
I'm in this Alone
This is My Problem
No one's Fault But my Own"
DepressDiaries|And as she slowly covered up her scars, she realized what she had done. Made her life even worse.
DepressDiaries|I try to block out the old memories as much as I can but sometimes they creep through and I fall apart all over again.
DepressDiaries|She stared at her reflection and softly whispered, I'm sorry I was never good enough for you.
DepressDiaries|At the end of the day, even after everything everyones done to me, the only person I really hate is myself.
DepressDiaries|There comes a point when you have just been so broken so many differnt ways its impossible to ever be put back together again.
DepressDiaries|My mind is my prison.
DepressDiaries|We can see the bright light at the end of the tunnel we soon realise it's just a train heading straight for us.
DepressDiaries|"Salty Tears,
Crimson gashes.
Shattered hearts,
Razor blade slashes."
DepressDiaries|No one cares. I don't belong. Not anywhere; I'm not that strong.
DepressDiaries|I can't be this fat anymore. It's breaking all that is left of me.
DepressDiaries|@delicatefailure I do.
DepressDiaries|@ED_Challenges I might have sent a DM this account while being on this account. God I'm an idiot.
DepressDiaries|"I hate when people say ""There are people who have it worse"" Has that ever really made somebody feel better?"
DepressDiaries|"You have the right to hate me
But you do not have the right to judge me"
DepressDiaries|Blackened tears flowing down to lips unkissed, ignore her and she'll no longer exist.
DepressDiaries|Water-proof mascara and bandaids won't do; the mascara still runs and the pain bleeds through.
DepressDiaries|"I look at my reflection and quickly turn away, 
and hope to god you don't see what I see in the mirror every day."
DepressDiaries|I can't even explain what I'm feeling, i just love you to death. . but I'm still so broken, I feel like I'm not whole enough.
DepressDiaries|Feeling alone is a lot like dying of thirst... you're slowly dying, and all the while you know something you need is missing...
DepressDiaries|"Once you're a cutter,
You're always a cutter,
No matter how much your scars fade,
It always crosses your mind to escape"
DepressDiaries|She cuts herself. Never too deep, never enough to die. But enough to feel the pain. Enough to feel the scream inside.
DepressDiaries|I'm mad at myself, not at you. I'm mad for always being nice, always apologizing for things I didn't do.
DepressDiaries|And once again I swallow the pain, and tell you don't worry I'm okay.
DepressDiaries|The taste of regretting yesterday is so strong.
DepressDiaries|I honestly never feel good enough for you, something is always wrong with me.
DepressDiaries|"Cuts on my wrist and scars on my heart.
Results of the years that have torn me apart"
DepressDiaries|I'm not okay, and I'm so not okay with being not okay.
DepressDiaries|I'm sorry I've been missing for so long. I just feel like I want to die.
DepressDiaries|Regrets should be left in the past, otherwise they scar what we have in the future.
DepressDiaries|I feel so lost
DepressDiaries|“It is not the one thing nor the other that leads to madness, but the space in between them.”
DepressDiaries|"Insecurity Kills
Starvation Fills"
DepressDiaries|I feel like nothing can save me, it's something I just can't undo.
DepressDiaries|I'll pull myself apart, to see whats underneath I'll cut out the pain, to see what it really means.
DepressDiaries|Lost touch with life a while ago, don't think I even want to come back.
DepressDiaries|I finally faced my demons, and they told me, what i was too scared to know. I am Alone.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes love doesn't die so much as it just fades into nothingness
DepressDiaries|I lock reality out of the room and sit in a peaceful solitude that doesn't exist.
DepressDiaries|I'm starting to think that depression and cutting is like a virus that never truly gets cured. It can be treated, but it never leaves you.
DepressDiaries|"You know the music isn't loud enough,
When you can still hear yourself,
Screaming and crying along with the words."
DepressDiaries|I was born with tragedy in my blood
DepressDiaries|"cause i wont let myself be happy
i wont be selfish again
but this pain is going to end 
whether I'm happy or not"
DepressDiaries|I'm the best at making the worst decisions.
DepressDiaries|She just doesn't feel worthy enough to tell anyone her feelings.
DepressDiaries|If you want the world to change, you can't just sit on the sidelines watching.
DepressDiaries|Paris, you're in my heart and prayers.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes it hurts a lot more to smile in front of everyone, then to cry alone.
DepressDiaries|I'm not giving up.. I'm just letting go..
DepressDiaries|If I could have one wish, it would be to have no reason to make one.
DepressDiaries|Hiding depression by hiding myself...
DepressDiaries|"...It all terrifies me,
But none of them can see,
That I'm alive but still half dead,
Nothings right inside my head..."
DepressDiaries|Fine is a meaningless answer to a question that you don't want to answer.
DepressDiaries|"Does it hurt more to die?
Or hurt more to stay alive?"
DepressDiaries|I am nothing that brings happiness, I only dwell in darkness and bring pain to those I love...
DepressDiaries|My neck hurts from trying to hold my head up high so much...
DepressDiaries|There's a smile on my face but I don't know why its there, I put it on to satisfy all the people that don't even care.
DepressDiaries|I'm the best at making the worst decisions.
DepressDiaries|She just doesn't feel worthy enough to tell anyone her feelings.
DepressDiaries|How can I possibly be happy with the body God gave me when there are so many people with better ones?
DepressDiaries|I guess some people are just born with tragedy in their blood.
DepressDiaries|"The worst feeling is not death,
Its knowing that u arent needed,
That u are alone in this world,
And that u no longer have a reason to live"
DepressDiaries|Would you love me.... if I were pretty?
DepressDiaries|"The scars on the outside that heal,
Are no substitute to the pain I feel"
DepressDiaries|I wish that I could disappear, unzip my skin and leave it here, so I could be no one again
DepressDiaries|Why get rid of the pain if its just gonna come back?
DepressDiaries|"Falling into Depression takes so many words and so much time 
And getting out of deppression takes more than words and much more time."
DepressDiaries|I will apologize for almost anything, but not for being damaged. Because that's the one thing I didn't do to myself.
DepressDiaries|I'd just rather be dead.
DepressDiaries|Close your eyes, the darkness you see, is the darkness I feel everyday.
DepressDiaries|The only thing the world and I have in common is that none of us care about me.
DepressDiaries|"I'm sick of crying...
But what else is better to do?"
DepressDiaries|It's like I'm being held under water, like I'm being pushed off a cliff, like I'm being shot, like I'm bleeding to death, but I'm not dying.
DepressDiaries|Why is it the ones that want you the least...are the ones that are able to hurt you the most?
DepressDiaries|This world is such a terrible and unfair place.
DepressDiaries|"You think you know me, but you're wrong. You don't know me at all. 
I don't want to die, I want to escape."
DepressDiaries|Who needs knives, I've got the last words you said to me... and they're as sharp as ever...
DepressDiaries|If you have something to say about me behind my back then say it to my face or you're just as bad as what you say I am.
DepressDiaries|Thank you guys! Now I have a whole list of Netflix shows/movies to keep me busy for a while. 😊
DepressDiaries|Netflix movie suggestions?? Nothing serious though.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes words aren't enough to express how depressed you truly are.
DepressDiaries|When you gave up on me, I gave up on me too.
DepressDiaries|It is easy to forgive others but extremely hard to forgive yourself.
DepressDiaries|I dwell on the past because I see no future.
DepressDiaries|"How many times can you lose everything?
I used to think that once was the limit..."
DepressDiaries|I spend all my time trying to fix what's wrong in my life instead of actually living it.
DepressDiaries|We have one thing in common.. we both hate me...
DepressDiaries|The cracks in the concrete remind that no matter how strong you are you will always fall apart.
DepressDiaries|Look in the mirror, no hope is left, too weak to renew, too strong to forget
DepressDiaries|There's a good side to getting hurt a lot...after a while it just doesn't bother you as much.
DepressDiaries|"Im trying to hold on,
But life is slipping away.
Each day it becomes more difficult,
More impossible to stay..."
DepressDiaries|You can close your eyes to reality but not to memories.
DepressDiaries|I may not be perfect by your standards but I'm perfect at being a screw up.
DepressDiaries|"Shes breaking up
She's falling down
She's crying for help
Without a sound..."
DepressDiaries|Do you know why I hate myself? I’m selfish, lonely, insecure, annoying, bitchy, but the main reason I hate myself is because I am me.
DepressDiaries|You remind me of the time, when I once knew who I was...
DepressDiaries|I sit here and starve because the pain of being hungry is the one kind of pain I can control.
DepressDiaries|It's kind of amazing really, how my own words do such a good job of destroying me.
DepressDiaries|I'd like to stay a secret like walking in the dark. If no one knows you, no one cares, and no one breaks your heart.
DepressDiaries|"And I'm not the girl I use to be
I have to admit, a lot of shit got to me"
DepressDiaries|Everyone is sleeping while she remains awake and leaves reminders on her body of how much she hates herself.
DepressDiaries|Behind these masks I show you, there is a broken girl with a shatterd smile and little hope that one day she may be happy.
DepressDiaries|"Even if I’m in pain
You’ll never see
I’ll pretend like I’m okay
Happier than can be"
DepressDiaries|Sometimes fitting in is a part of life, but eventually you realize, it's not easy to be ordinary.
DepressDiaries|When all you want to do is curl up into a tiny ball where no one can reach you and hope that the hurting stops...
DepressDiaries|I used to be someone.
DepressDiaries|What may be considered haunted dreams for you, is simply everyday life for me.
DepressDiaries|I want to go back to believing in everything... And knowing nothing at all.
DepressDiaries|Believing a lie is so much easier than facing the truth.
DepressDiaries|I said I wanted to grow up, not become a whole different person.
DepressDiaries|Is life really worth all this pain?
DepressDiaries|I can't lose people who were never really there.
DepressDiaries|Every day I feel the pain and everyday I pretend I don't....and no one ever notices.
DepressDiaries|Pain runs much deeper than the skin, the pain I feel comes from within.
DepressDiaries|I wish I could run far enough to get away from myself... its got to be easier than dealing with the feelings I've felt...
DepressDiaries|"What do they have that I don't?
Oh yea I forgot...
A happy life"
DepressDiaries|"You haven't felt this pain
You haven't suffered like this
You haven't been depressed
So don't tell me you understand"
DepressDiaries|And most people dont know what its like to look in the mirror and wonder who's staring back at you.
DepressDiaries|The only problem with me is that I am the problem.
DepressDiaries|Nobody can hurt you http://t.co/5ECYjYj6Gn
DepressDiaries|I don't deserve anything http://t.co/EeDp29KhKK
DepressDiaries|The one thing that never leaves me... http://t.co/QIKgqbJGH2
DepressDiaries|Beauty comes from pain http://t.co/IidUoSGhr7
DepressDiaries|I'm afraid http://t.co/iYEGPxHCsy
DepressDiaries|Every single day http://t.co/6yAyDYLM8g
DepressDiaries|It hurts http://t.co/04vHHTSNMF
DepressDiaries|Being hated or being ignored http://t.co/GOfAh5Zc9r
DepressDiaries|Hate http://t.co/4k4ELr0cQB
DepressDiaries|Regret http://t.co/6OUdaBFquT
DepressDiaries|Most memories pray to be forgotten.
DepressDiaries|A picture is a reminder of what they took from me...
DepressDiaries|Please forgive me for not being pretty.
DepressDiaries|Reality is the cruelest illusion.
DepressDiaries|I never changed, I just got tired pretending to be happy...
DepressDiaries|You can take the blade from her hand but you can't take the pain from her heart.
DepressDiaries|"Somewhere I lost my wings,
I didn't stand so tall;
Even angels sometimes,
Have to eventually fall"
DepressDiaries|Not seeing a future, living meaningless. Where am I going?
DepressDiaries|Alice in Wonderland is on DisneyJr!!!!!! #yourewelcome
DepressDiaries|"http://t.co/drwTcRukzN.Her.Enemy,
The.Scales.Not.Her.Friend,
Bones.To.Her.Are.Beautiful,
She'll.Starve.Untill.The.End..."
DepressDiaries|I'd ask what else could go wrong but I fear God would see that as a challenge.
DepressDiaries|I like being alone because then I don't have to pretend like everything is okay.
DepressDiaries|And I've never felt this pain any worse than the moment I looked up and noticed I've been alone this whole time...
DepressDiaries|"My scars with eventually go away,
But I have to deal with my pain day by day."
DepressDiaries|Pretending has become my greatest lie.
DepressDiaries|I wanna walk away from life, but I'm worried about who may follow.
DepressDiaries|Because the mirror hurts more than starving.
DepressDiaries|What hurts more than no one understanding me, is no one trying to understand.
DepressDiaries|Fade into the background. That's the only place you'll ever fit in.
DepressDiaries|I feel like I'm a million miles away from myself more and more these days.
DepressDiaries|I can't do this on my own anymore. My strength is fading, and my mask is cracking and breaking.
DepressDiaries|I'm going to smile like nothings wrong, talk like everythings perfect, act like its all a dream, and pretend it's not hurting me.
DepressDiaries|"I feel like I'm losing everything I've ever known.
This is what happens when secret emotions are shown."
DepressDiaries|Her eyes filled with the agony of waking, filled with the stories she had to tell. Every morning the same thing, the same everyday hell.
DepressDiaries|I'm never safe, not even in my own skin.
DepressDiaries|Being able to survive it, doesn't mean that it was ever okay.
DepressDiaries|I've lost the pain I used to feel, the only problem is the numbness just wont fade..
DepressDiaries|Why has the world turned on me and why have I turned on myself?
DepressDiaries|Look beyond the smile and see the emptiness inside. Look beyond the laughter and see the tears she hides.
DepressDiaries|And she wanted everyone to know that it's not her heartbreak that killed her, it was the need to be happy that did.
DepressDiaries|Those who do not remember the past are condemed to repeat it.
DepressDiaries|Forgetting yesterday's thoughts, tripping over today's mistakes, and hiding from tomorrow's consequences.
DepressDiaries|Do you ever feel like if you were prettier life would be easier?
DepressDiaries|I've finally lost hope in everything.
DepressDiaries|See through my eyes and live my life, then we'll see how long you'll survive.
DepressDiaries|The next fake smile she makes could be the last smile you ever see from her.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes the person that gave you life makes you want to die.
DepressDiaries|I know my life could be so much worse but that doesn't mean what I'm going through doesn't hurt like hell.
DepressDiaries|"If a tree falls and no one is around does it make a sound?
If a girl screams and no one is around does she still exist?"
DepressDiaries|I already told you I was broken, but you had to go and try to break me more.
DepressDiaries|"It's kind of like it's something living inside you. 
Something you can't get rid of because
Killing it means killing you."
DepressDiaries|I love it when it rains.....because for once the world looks like I feel.
DepressDiaries|When people say they'll always be there they only mean, that as you fall they will stand and stare.
DepressDiaries|"Looking for a reason
Just to stay here today
Looking for a way
Just to make it through the day"
DepressDiaries|At the end of the day, even after everything everyones done to me, the only person I really hate is myself.
DepressDiaries|The smile on my face is just a prop and the laughter you hear is just sound effects.
DepressDiaries|Only a hero can look into someones eyes and know the secrets that person hides.
DepressDiaries|One part of me is still fighting, the other part of me is already gone.
DepressDiaries|Am I the only one failing at life?
DepressDiaries|Sometimes it hits me all of the sudden. I try to block out the old memories but sometimes they creep through &amp; I fall apart all over again.
DepressDiaries|You cannot see the future with tears in your eyes.
DepressDiaries|"Here alone I stand,
With no one by my side;
So holding no one's hand,
Myself I must find."
DepressDiaries|I feel ugly. I look ugly. I am ugly.
DepressDiaries|It's not that bad--I'm not that sad...it only hurts when I'm breathing...
DepressDiaries|Being alone is like climbing a mountain, you can see everyone but no one can see you.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes, its easier to let the sky cry for you.
DepressDiaries|There comes a point when you have just been so broken so many differnt ways its impossible to ever be put back together again.
DepressDiaries|If the world rejects me, where do I have left to go?
DepressDiaries|"Forget the impression that I make
Forget the smiles that I fake
Forget the lies you think are true
Because I'm not the me you thought u knew"
DepressDiaries|"All I've got are screams inside 
But somehow they come out in a smile"
DepressDiaries|"I'm
Too weak to fight,
Too tired to try,
Too broken to stand
Too angry to care"
DepressDiaries|Though the fall will kill me for a moment I will fly.
DepressDiaries|We cease loving ourselves if no one loves us.
DepressDiaries|@itsktbitches1 Wow really? That's awful. I guess all the tattoos and t-shirts in the world really won't teach people anything.
DepressDiaries|"""Normal"" people actually like themselves?? That's unfathomable to me."
DepressDiaries|When you look at me you see a strong woman, but when I look in the mirror I see a broken child.
DepressDiaries|I think I'm falling apart and the only thing I can do is let it happen and hope someone is there to hold me together.
DepressDiaries|I would rather, have a million people hate me for who am, Then have a million people love me for who I am not.
DepressDiaries|"Her eyes begin to burn
As this acid runs down her face
Scarring her once beautiful features
With memories of distaste"
DepressDiaries|Water-proof mascara and bandaids won't do; the mascara still runs and the pain bleeds through.
DepressDiaries|"It's sad how we live to die,
But it sadder when we want to die to live."
DepressDiaries|The only thing that's keeping me alive is the thought that maybe someday, I might be the one keeping someone else alive.
DepressDiaries|It's always the quiet ones who have the most to say.
DepressDiaries|I can't even explain what I'm feeling, I just love you to death...but I'm still so broken, I feel like I'm not whole enough for you.
DepressDiaries|"It takes a special person to realize that everything about that ""beautiful"" smile of yours is just a coverup for all the hurt and lies."
DepressDiaries|I'm scared that everyone will find out about my secret life.
DepressDiaries|"She tried to be there for everyone else,
But doesn't realize she's falling apart, herself."
DepressDiaries|@lisarowe261 DM me when you have a chance if you need too love :)
DepressDiaries|@itsktbitches1 That's terrible. It's even worse considering when u tell someone u have a mental illness they treat u like u have the plague.
DepressDiaries|Can we please stop killing lions, tigers, rhinos, elephants, gorillas lemurs, bears &amp; a bunch of other animals for sport!! It's disgusting.
DepressDiaries|@itsktbitches1 I know exactly what you mean. I thought about them for at least 6 months before getting any of my tattoos.
DepressDiaries|@itsktbitches1 That's really, really pretty! I like it a lot!
DepressDiaries|@itsktbitches1 I can't even deal with that shit.
DepressDiaries|@itsktbitches1 Are you freaking kidding me??
DepressDiaries|"I look at my reflection and quickly turn away, 
And hope to God you don't see what I see in the mirror everyday."
DepressDiaries|"Once you're a cutter,
You're always a cutter,
No matter how much your scars fade...
It always crosses your mind to escape"
DepressDiaries|I didn't give up... I gave in.
DepressDiaries|"I'm mad at myself, not at you.
I'm mad for always being nice...always apologizing for things I didn't do..."
DepressDiaries|I honestly never feel good enough for you, something is always wrong with me.
DepressDiaries|Its hard to believe someone that says you're beautiful, when everyday you tell yourself you're not....
DepressDiaries|It's easy to tell me not to kill myself, it's hard to care when I decide to stick around.
DepressDiaries|"She can sit in her room,
With her headphones blasting,
But it'll never drown out the sound of her screams..."
DepressDiaries|Don't judge me from what you see, because remember, things aren't what they always appear to be.
DepressDiaries|"I am beaten.
I am scorned.
Yet, hell has no fury like a soul entirely crushed and torn."
DepressDiaries|"She's waiting for the one guy to come along and see past her lies
She wants him to look deep down into her eyes and see why she cries"
DepressDiaries|If you know how I feel then I feel sorry for you.
DepressDiaries|Isn't it a shame when you're supposed to be alive, but you don't see the point in even living?
DepressDiaries|"My mind will erase every detail 
But my heart will always remember"
DepressDiaries|I was always losing from the moment I let myself accept the darkness and hatered of this world.
DepressDiaries|The world of illness is lonely. One is isolated by their fears.
DepressDiaries|I never meant to fall this far.
DepressDiaries|I wish i could be free, free from myself and the cage of my own making.
DepressDiaries|At least when you feel pain you know that you are alive. When you are numb, you are just another being in this pointless thing called life.
DepressDiaries|My feelings are so hard to express that sometimes its better just to lock them inside,
DepressDiaries|People hurt me, people don't deserve me, people say mean words but it's always myself that I hate the most at the end of the day.
DepressDiaries|What's the point in talking, if nobody ever listens to a word I say?
DepressDiaries|People hurt me, people don't deserve me, people say mean words but it's always myself that I hate the most at the end of the day.
DepressDiaries|What's the point in talking, if nobody ever listens to a word I say?
DepressDiaries|This is such a lonely life.
DepressDiaries|I miss the way I used to be. I miss the way I used to feel. I miss the girl who died and left me in her place.
DepressDiaries|What do you do when you can't take it anymore? Fake it.
DepressDiaries|"How can you take so much from me and not see it.
I can't please you at all..."
DepressDiaries|She asks why haven't I slept for days and what's eating me alive....without even having the slightest idea that she was the cause of it.
DepressDiaries|I've made a mess of me and I don't know how to clean it up.
DepressDiaries|"How old was she when ""fat"" became an emotion?"
DepressDiaries|@Dinobunny_518 Me too!!! That one really bugs some people lol
DepressDiaries|I'm always apologizing. Constantly saying I'm sorry to ppl where it actually annoys them. What the hell happened in my house to create that?
DepressDiaries|I can't keep going day after day without sleep.
DepressDiaries|Yes! Yes, I did just freak out on Facebook about thousands of people getting a semicolon tattoo. Depression isn't a fucking fad.
DepressDiaries|I don't feel like a butterfly... http://t.co/cWKZU5hEYS
DepressDiaries|Just because we bury them doesn't mean they're gone forever. http://t.co/48deS700zk

DepressDiaries|That's what hurts the most http://t.co/IhrRHXu4v1
DepressDiaries|This is funny because I have a very similar conversation with my therapist. http://t.co/Q5N0gqRf82
DepressDiaries|@TakeOnUrWorld ...extra senstative. Sorry that was so long! Lol
DepressDiaries|"@TakeOnUrWorld ...the world, ya know? But it a ton a people get them for ""support"" then it me, it losses it's meaning. Maybe I'm being..."
DepressDiaries|@TakeOnUrWorld ...I'm getting one!! And I think I was so upset bc I was going to get one &amp; it's like a way of not hiding &amp; coming out to...
DepressDiaries|@TakeOnUrWorld ...remember him. Except that the ; represents that we choose to go on. Anyway, she had so many comments with people saying...
DepressDiaries|@TakeOnUrWorld It blew up my Facebook yesterday. The girl got it because her cousin committed suicide, which i understand wanting to...
DepressDiaries|I can't sleep because all l can think about is how fat and disgusting I am.
DepressDiaries|A semicolon tattoo is not a fad!!! You don't know what we go through so don't tattoo yourself like you do. Let us have something of our own!
DepressDiaries|THIS!!!!! http://t.co/wt2qH7hQmH
DepressDiaries|I can't put up this strong front much longer, it's about to fall.
DepressDiaries|I dont say how i feel because once i do it becomes real.
DepressDiaries|I'm so messed up, I don't even know how to explain how I feel anymore.
DepressDiaries|There's an emptiness inside of her, that she'd do anything to fill in.
DepressDiaries|Even if things just so happen to get better....the damage has already been done.
DepressDiaries|Falling, and I'm to heavy for anyone to catch me.
DepressDiaries|You drink to forget and then you want to remember.
DepressDiaries|And we don't know why, but we fear how we feel inside.
DepressDiaries|You haven't felt pain until you can't feel it anymore.
DepressDiaries|Give me my blade, Give me my pills, Give me something to live for then maybe I'll give them back...
DepressDiaries|I'm too lost to be saved.
DepressDiaries|When you look at me do you see me? Or do you look right through me, like I'm not even there?
DepressDiaries|Just because I'm used to people walking out of my life, doesn't mean it gets any easier.
DepressDiaries|I'm just another heartbroken pathetic soul in this world of no understanding that's trying to find a purpose in life.
DepressDiaries|I have always been scared of you. And now I have become scared of the person I have grown to be. Because the person I am is just like you.
DepressDiaries|I feel everything you're afraid too.
DepressDiaries|"Everyday I wake up and lie to you all...
I make myself fly when I just want to fall..."
DepressDiaries|Wanting to be somebody you could never be...is not only a sin but a tragedy.
DepressDiaries|Inside my mind I search to find a place just to call my own.
DepressDiaries|I'm torn between two lives, and neither of them want me.
DepressDiaries|"Your words stab me,
Like a knife in the heart.
They sting like hell,
Then tear me apart."
DepressDiaries|Its funny how you know you are living a lie… yet wishing for it to never end.
DepressDiaries|"You killed what I used to be..
Now you're killing what is left of me.."
DepressDiaries|They say hold in there like it's going to go away sometime soon.
DepressDiaries|I want to fall asleep in your arms and never wake up... Because I love you but I still want to die.
DepressDiaries|I wish everyone saw me the way I do, that way they would just let me die.
DepressDiaries|"I looked into his eyes and realized that he was different, 
He had changed..
A world of sadness..
He's no longer the same"
DepressDiaries|Never alone....Always lonely
DepressDiaries|Why did the worst and the best things in my life switch places?
DepressDiaries|The only thing left holding me together are all these scars.
DepressDiaries|Everyday is just another day where I want to escape.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I wonder if it is worth it, when no one is going to care in the end.
DepressDiaries|How do I say how much I hurt without screaming in pain and anguish? I can't, but you really couldn’t care less. Could you?
DepressDiaries|I listen to my music loud so I can't hear myself scream
DepressDiaries|"When you finally think you have something...
You realize that its really nothing at all..."
DepressDiaries|"You are all blind,
You have your eyes open,
And yet you see nothing."
DepressDiaries|I just want a day to go by, when I'm not pretending to be happy...
DepressDiaries|It feels like the world is flooded with pain &amp; Im left out at sea, unable to swim &amp; drowning in my misery bc Im not good enough to be saved.
DepressDiaries|"The path I walk is dark, the lights blackened long ago.
The darkness is intoxicating, consuming my body, mind and soul."
DepressDiaries|"The only thing I have ever known
Is pain and anger while all alone"
DepressDiaries|The way I live was never meant to impress you.
DepressDiaries|I can't be the person you want me to be and I won't apologize for that anymore.
DepressDiaries|You can pick me out from the crowd because I'm the girl with the broken smile.
DepressDiaries|There is only one way to understand cutting and I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
DepressDiaries|By destroying myself I have achieved what I have wanted for all my life...happiness.
DepressDiaries|Pretending doesn't do anything but make you long for what you pretend to have.
DepressDiaries|Tears and pain are all I've got now, there the only things no one can take from me.
DepressDiaries|"You have smoking
And I have cutting
They are both addicting
And they are always killing"
DepressDiaries|You remind me of the times when I knew who I was.
DepressDiaries|The ghost of my soul wanders around my mind, numb to all feelings of happiness.
DepressDiaries|No matter how much I hope or pray nothing ever seems to go my way.
DepressDiaries|Love? Why would anyone want to love me? I have nothing for them. I.... I am nothing.....
DepressDiaries|Sometimes you see the path before you... and yet you wonder where you're headed.
DepressDiaries|I just can't go one living with the facade I put up. I lied. I'm not fine, I need a change.
DepressDiaries|"She's distraught,
She cannot cope.
Real tears,
False wishes and hope."
DepressDiaries|Somehow, for some reason - I just don't care anymore.
DepressDiaries|And sometimes when I'm wearing sunglasses, with my face to the sunshine, I let the tears flow down my cheeks.
DepressDiaries|What do you do when you can't go on anymore, keep walking or close all the doors?
DepressDiaries|"Dead in her mind
And cold to the bone
She opened her eyes
And realized she was alone"
DepressDiaries|"Inside this mirror, I see myself
Trapped behind a face no longer mine
I seem to be the only one
Who can see my bitter decline"
DepressDiaries|I'd rather be dead than this fat.
DepressDiaries|Too many http://t.co/76JSHcaTY1
DepressDiaries|So the world wouldn't seem so dark http://t.co/LMilFfqpQW
DepressDiaries|Maybe http://t.co/SpeWa7NV8Q

DepressDiaries|It hurts so damn bad http://t.co/h1lDs2crcI
DepressDiaries|That's just how I am http://t.co/gaem847O7I
DepressDiaries|"Live your life in solitude and never say a word,
For even if you speak...
Your words are never heard..."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes it hurts...So I just smile
DepressDiaries|"I don't want to look back
But the past is always tapping my shoulder"
DepressDiaries|Walk alone, talk alone, always be alone
DepressDiaries|My depression is your happiness.
DepressDiaries|Why can't I forget all the things I regret?
DepressDiaries|I can't face myself when I wake up, and look at myself in the mirror, I'm so ashamed of me.
DepressDiaries|A pain so deep she can barely breathe, a simple longing to no longer be.
DepressDiaries|Is it so much to ask to have a friend who will be there for you no matter what?
DepressDiaries|"I would like to stay a secret,
Like walking in the dark,
If no one knows me, and no one cares
Then no one breaks my heart."
DepressDiaries|And she became just what they said she would worthless and alone.
DepressDiaries|Looks like I'm worth nothing after all...
DepressDiaries|Try to keep this in your mind... http://t.co/jxUfKmscru

DepressDiaries|My baby boy is still sick. #heartbroken
DepressDiaries|@brycetedeschi I hope so! lol
DepressDiaries|@brycetedeschi You're proud you wouldn't care if someone killed themselves?
DepressDiaries|My baby is sick and there's nothing I can do.
DepressDiaries|"Everyone wants something beautiful,
God, I wish I was beautiful."
DepressDiaries|Life is meant to be made cruel. You just have to be tough enough to live it. But I don't think I can take it anymore.
DepressDiaries|Life doesn't get any better, you just get used to it being this way and it seems like it does.
DepressDiaries|I tried to be perfect, but take a guess...I failed at that too!
DepressDiaries|I've played pretend so long... I don't even know the real me.
DepressDiaries|So sick of being the way I am...
DepressDiaries|"I see all the people, but they don't see me
I hate this life, and I hate me"
DepressDiaries|Another day passes by and darkness is all that surrounds me.
DepressDiaries|"For once i just want to say ""I don't care"" and mean it."
DepressDiaries|"My reflection
It's everything I hate yet,
It's everything I am."
DepressDiaries|I love you because you walked in when the rest of the world walked out.
DepressDiaries|Dear Body, shrink or die. And no, I don't give a damn which one you choose.
DepressDiaries|It's also the only show that makes me worry about being to thin. (Ya know, cause you're easier to grab) ...But then I get over it lol
DepressDiaries|I watch Criminal Minds way to much. I already have a list of the top ways I'd probably be killed.
DepressDiaries|"Lieing wil kill you in the end,
Because at one moment, you start to drown in them..."
DepressDiaries|You not being there when I needed you the most was the one thing that kept me ill.
DepressDiaries|I never trust anyone...least of all myself.
DepressDiaries|A little bit shy, a little too quiet, the mixed up girl that everybody leaves behind.
DepressDiaries|"You took my heart and tore it to pieces.
You broke me down with the greatest of eases."
DepressDiaries|Life is breaking my heart.
DepressDiaries|"Isolated, Bruised, Broken, Torn, Crumbling, Lost, Alone, Cold, Invisible. 
Pick a name, they all mean me."
DepressDiaries|What's a normal childhood anyway?
DepressDiaries|Don't drink to drown your sorrows, for sorrows are like fish and can swim.
DepressDiaries|Everyone is sad now and then, but this pain never seems to go away.
DepressDiaries|I look in the mirror and I'm the only one to see the scares that are on the inside.
DepressDiaries|I wonder, If I try hard enough, Maybe I can remember being happy?
DepressDiaries|It's not drowning I'm afraid of, it's this breathing that takings all this work.
DepressDiaries|I wish these thoughts would go away, because it's hurting like hell to be this way.
DepressDiaries|You don't know me, you only know who I'm pretending to be
DepressDiaries|"So tired of the mask hiding my pain
Yet too scared to take it off and let it happen again"
DepressDiaries|Sounds easy http://t.co/DQx9ASxePq
DepressDiaries|I just wonder http://t.co/q3tCJiNarW

DepressDiaries|Silence http://t.co/Sj93TuSJ0R
DepressDiaries|Note to self http://t.co/Ww2SI9v7re
DepressDiaries|And we don't know why but we fear how we feel inside.
DepressDiaries|I'm too lost to be saved
DepressDiaries|Can everyone please just stop with all the Father's Day shit. It's still like 2 weeks away. I'm sick and tired of hearing about it!!!
DepressDiaries|Shit happens....but mostly to me so don't worry.
DepressDiaries|Everyone has a different fight. A different wound that keeps them bleeding.
DepressDiaries|"Their words so sharp they cut like a blade,
Their words so sharp they just won't fade."
DepressDiaries|These tears are stinging my eyes, but I won't let them fall...
DepressDiaries|I wish these thoughts would go away, because it's hurting like hell to be this way.
DepressDiaries|You don't know me, you only know who I'm pretending to be
DepressDiaries|Smile as if you mean it. They can't tell the difference.
DepressDiaries|"Unloved
Unwanted
That's the way its always been
And always will be..."
DepressDiaries|You drink to forget and then you want to remember
DepressDiaries|They keep telling me that someday it will all make sense and I will be happy...
DepressDiaries|Life is so hard when you're faced to the mirror...
DepressDiaries|And we don't know why but we fear how we feel inside.
DepressDiaries|Give me my blade, Give me my pills, Give me something to live for then maybe I'll give them back...
DepressDiaries|This disease in which they call life is nothing but a metaphor for hell.
DepressDiaries|I'm too lost to be saved
DepressDiaries|Just because I'm used to people walking out of my life, doesn't mean it gets any easier.
DepressDiaries|In the end the only person going to be there for you is you.
DepressDiaries|"I can't tolerate your sadness
Cause it's me you're drowning
I won't allow any happiness
Cause every time you laugh, I feel so guilty"
DepressDiaries|I'm lost in a world that doesn't even know I exist.
DepressDiaries|The saddest thing is life is knowing that you fell and couldn't get back up.
DepressDiaries|Everyone seems to be finding happiness, I guess I'm just falling a little behind.
DepressDiaries|In the truest part of our hearts everybody's afraid.
DepressDiaries|I ran out of clean slates to start over...
DepressDiaries|She's the girl with her middle finger in the air because for the first time she just doesn't fucking care.
DepressDiaries|Shocked as I looked deep within my soul to realize that I was dead all along. Trembling in fear, afraid of who I've become.
DepressDiaries|I'm sorry I couldn't be what you wanted.
DepressDiaries|I thought my pain was hidden until I saw my scars.
DepressDiaries|I feel everything you're afraid too.
DepressDiaries|Just another lost soul wondering the earth, waiting for someone to find me.
DepressDiaries|I'm all alone to fight these demons on my own and I don't know if I can take it.
DepressDiaries|When things look empty, I wish you hope.
DepressDiaries|Insomnia is the devil.
DepressDiaries|"I just want to be thin.
Is it going to fix 98% of my problems? No.
But at least I'll be thin."
DepressDiaries|I can't sleep when all I can do is lay in bed and continually think how fat I am.
DepressDiaries|You see me only when you need me otherwise I'm invisible to you.
DepressDiaries|Inside my mind I search to find a place just to call my own...
DepressDiaries|"Whats wrong with me?
What have I become?
A slut and a whore,
The worst you can even imagine,
And maybe even more."
DepressDiaries|Hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable.
DepressDiaries|I'm torn between two lives, and neither of them want me.
DepressDiaries|Everyone that crossed my path, left me with my darkest half.
DepressDiaries|"There's a pair of dead eyes in the mirror looking back at me.
I guess it's wrong to live life so lifelessly."
DepressDiaries|"There's a voice in my head telling me why I should hate you,
But I hate myself instead."
DepressDiaries|"I feel a tingling in my veins...
Where you've found peace I've found pain."
DepressDiaries|"Smiling is my magic trick,
Magic creates an illusion,
This magic hides my secret,
The pain, My minds intrusion"
DepressDiaries|My tears have lost all meaning since they are shed so often.
DepressDiaries|I'm the perfect image of this blood stained world.
DepressDiaries|"This is the beginning of the end...
My future is becoming my past."
DepressDiaries|Its funny how you know you are living a lie… yet wishing for it to never end.
DepressDiaries|What do you do when your life becomes a chore?
DepressDiaries|They say hold in there like it's going to go away sometime soon.
DepressDiaries|She's On The Verge Of Self Destruction... Lets Start The Countdown...
DepressDiaries|..The more I try, The more we fall apart..
DepressDiaries|She doesn't fear pain...it is her closest friend
DepressDiaries|"Mmmbop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du, yeah"
DepressDiaries|"In an mmmbop they're gone
In an mmmbop they're not there
Until you lose your hair
Oh
But you don't care"
DepressDiaries|"I'm waiting, for the breakdown.
I'm waiting, for the comedown."
DepressDiaries|So take care what you wish for, it may come true.
DepressDiaries|"Oh, the night becomes the space 
That's somewhere in between
What I feel and what I'm told"
DepressDiaries|"And every now and again sometimes,
I get lost on the wind of a dream
The rope gets loose, the chains unbind.
And I can do anything."
DepressDiaries|"The pain it won't even cross my mind.
There is wonder in everything.
The rope gets loose and the chains unbind.
And I can do anything."
DepressDiaries|@fuxkedhead Because it's so terrible a thing that no one should have to understand it, ya know?
DepressDiaries|You know my name, not my story.
DepressDiaries|I'm just a broken person. Living in a broken world, waiting to be noticed, and waiting to be found.
DepressDiaries|"Look into my eyes, and tell me what you see.
Can you see the pain, or just yourself staring at me?"
DepressDiaries|I don't want to be the me he used to know.
DepressDiaries|Go ahead and try but there's nothing left of me to break.
DepressDiaries|Why did the worst and the best things in my life switch places?
DepressDiaries|It's hard to remember life without you...back in the days when I didnt know what happiness or love was...
DepressDiaries|Maybe I'm nobody, maybe I'm just nothing with something everyone has...And if thats true them I'm only their trash.
DepressDiaries|"Hate Me or Love Me
For I Will Always Stay True
To Me And Not You"
DepressDiaries|"I hate myself more with every breath that I take. 
My tears are poison which suffocate my soul.
As guilt consumes me I will never be whole."
DepressDiaries|"My ""good mornings"" are cursed,
My smile is fake."
DepressDiaries|I hold my breath as this life starts to take it's toll. I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds.
DepressDiaries|@fuxkedhead That makes me so sad. If you need anything, just DM me lovie. 😘
DepressDiaries|I can't trust you anymore.
DepressDiaries|Everytime you hurt me, I hope I'm going to die.
DepressDiaries|The worse enemy lies within the self.
DepressDiaries|A blanket of insanity masks my insecurity.
DepressDiaries|I listen to my music loud so I can't hear myself scream
DepressDiaries|"I'm losing everything...
It's like the suns going down on me..."
DepressDiaries|"When you finally think you have something...
You realize that its really nothing at all..."
DepressDiaries|I just want a day to go by, when I'm not pretending to be happy...
DepressDiaries|Yes, theres something wrong with me.
DepressDiaries|I've ran out of strength to endure
DepressDiaries|"The only thing I have ever known
Is pain and anger while all alone"
DepressDiaries|Pretending to be happy is one thing. Actually being happy is a whole different situation...
DepressDiaries|The way I live was never meant to impress you.
DepressDiaries|"I'm living a lie
Why can't anyone
Just look into my eyes
To see the truth"
DepressDiaries|I can't be the person you want me to be and I won't apologize for that anymore.
DepressDiaries|I'M SO FREAKING FAT!!! I HATE MYSELF!!!!!!
DepressDiaries|The bandages cover the wounds but they don't cover the pain.
DepressDiaries|"When I look in the mirror
I don't like what I see
It's like someone put a curse on me"
DepressDiaries|Sometimes you see the path before you... and yet you wonder where you're headed.
DepressDiaries|I may act like a jerk, I may push you all away with my words, but it's only because my heart can't bear someone walking away again.
DepressDiaries|Too little, too late... Story of my damn life.
DepressDiaries|Can you see me? All of me? Probably not, no one ever really has.
DepressDiaries|Such little shoulders can't carry this heavy heart of yours.
DepressDiaries|This is such a lonely life.
DepressDiaries|I miss normal people work outs
DepressDiaries|@sad__alone_ Aww, thank you so much sweets!! That made my day...will probably end up making my week. If you ever need anything just DM me! 💖
DepressDiaries|You find love, but in the end tragedy finds you.
DepressDiaries|I can't put up this strong front much longer. It's about to fall.
DepressDiaries|Theres nothing left to say...besides goodbye.
DepressDiaries|I don't say how I feel because once I do it becomes real.
DepressDiaries|I stopped cutting for you...but now, I have nothing to stop me. You fixed me, just to break me. So thank you.
DepressDiaries|When you realize that you never meant anything to him, and you start to wonder if you even matter to anyone...
DepressDiaries|Eventually she just, gave up on everything.
DepressDiaries|There's an emptiness inside of her, that she'd do anything to fill it in.
DepressDiaries|@Prettyinthin If I know you, you're underweight. xoxo
DepressDiaries|"I've had time, 
And I've had change.
I've been so broken and yet I still can't explain..."
DepressDiaries|Just tear me apart, once &amp; for all.
DepressDiaries|I have learned to block it all out. I figured that if I ignore the pain long enough, it will simply go away...forever.
DepressDiaries|I question my existence...
DepressDiaries|I always believed that fear belonged to other people, weaker people, and it would never touch me. But then it did.
DepressDiaries|Nightmares are when fantasy and reality collide...
DepressDiaries|They say you are what you eat. So I will be nothing.
DepressDiaries|Apparently we're not the people we thought we were, and I never became the person I wanted to be.
DepressDiaries|I just can't go one living with the facade I put up. I lied. I'm not fine, I need a change.
DepressDiaries|"She's distraught,
She cannot cope.
Real tears,
False wishes and hope."
DepressDiaries|And on my shoulders I take, the weight of the world... and I break, tried to stand tall, oh how I fall.
DepressDiaries|"I don't bite the hand that feeds,
I push it away."
DepressDiaries|"You can still laugh when you are miserable,
You just can't feel the warmth that laughter brings"
DepressDiaries|Behind my eyes, is the nightmare that you'll never dream.
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker_ I dislike that. If you ever need anything just DM me please.
DepressDiaries|@RushMyPancake @Noelle42627486 ...means u help me break through and show me that there is another option. You can find happiness in sadness.
DepressDiaries|@RushMyPancake @Noelle42627486 This is not racism! Black &amp; white is a representation of pain and happiness. To say you are my color means...
DepressDiaries|I'm one of those 2% http://t.co/p4PLZPv8vL

DepressDiaries|I hate who I am http://t.co/j3paPeXXoO
DepressDiaries|I'm hiding http://t.co/5yNED9cFBn
DepressDiaries|It's okay http://t.co/VWVVTKC1fc
DepressDiaries|"Depression may not be a fatal disease,
But it can kill as effectively as cancer."
DepressDiaries|The worst part about depression is burying the little good times so the bad memories hurt less when they are made.
DepressDiaries|The sweet revenge of hate.
DepressDiaries|I want you to see me cry so you'll know what you've brought me to.
DepressDiaries|"It seems that every day I'm asking myself ""Why me?"""
DepressDiaries|"We are nothing but shadows of ourselves...
Look how far we have fallen..."
DepressDiaries|I see the disapproving looks, I hear the disapproving whispers, why can't you just accept me for who I am and get on with your own life?
DepressDiaries|Ask yourself, if you where in my shoes would you rather be dead or stuck in a world where no one wants to help?
DepressDiaries|You are my color in this black and white world.
DepressDiaries|She is falling apart...Beautifully
DepressDiaries|I just want to remember what it's like to feel happiness
DepressDiaries|@UnbreakableIzMe Btw, Congratulations on being clean for so long. That's amazing, you should be so proud of yourself!! xoxo
DepressDiaries|@UnbreakableIzMe Actually the woman on the phone told me not to put antiviral software on it, so I dunno
DepressDiaries|I've had my new phone 2 months and it has a virus and needs to be replaced. Seriously?? This shit only happens to me.
DepressDiaries|Put a big smile on when your hurt so then no one will ask questions.
DepressDiaries|"I hope I'm good at acting;
cause it's time to put on a show"
DepressDiaries|I bet sleep is a gift God only gives to pretty people.
DepressDiaries|"I can't sleep,
This sadness has got too deep..."
DepressDiaries|Why do I feel the need to erase my life when I haven't even lived it?
DepressDiaries|Sometimes knowing nothing is better than knowing it all.
DepressDiaries|There's no one here to talk to, I'm keeping it all inside. No one knows the pain I feel, It's more than I can hide.
DepressDiaries|I wish I could cry, but this is a different kind of pain, the kind that will remain.
DepressDiaries|"Live your life in solitude and never say a word, 
For even if you speak...
Your words are never heard..."
DepressDiaries|I'm feeling weak...missing parts...incomplete...
DepressDiaries|Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray?
DepressDiaries|"I don't wanna look back
But the past is always tapping my shoulder"
DepressDiaries|My depression is your happiness.
DepressDiaries|Why can't I forget all the things I regret?
DepressDiaries|I can't face myself when I wake up, and look at myself in the mirror, I'm so ashamed of me...
DepressDiaries|A mask of confidence, a smile untrue, been faking so long she can laugh on cue.
DepressDiaries|You're okay for a while and then you fall back to where you were
DepressDiaries|@cookiechipzouis Make sure you let me know when that day comes!!! xoxo
DepressDiaries|@cookiechipzouis It's okay if you don't think so because I know so. So I will believe for you until you are ready to believe on your own.
DepressDiaries|In a way I'm actually proud. I know I can survive hell. I'm stronger than they are, and that's something they can never take away from me.
DepressDiaries|I guess it does feel nice not to have to hide it anymore. I'm not ashamed. I'm tired of apologizing for who I am. I won't do it anymore.
DepressDiaries|But why bother hiding it anymore? None of those actually people care. But then again why would they? It's not like it effects their lives.
DepressDiaries|It doesn't really make me feel better because I guess at the end of the day I know those people have no idea what I'm talking about.
DepressDiaries|"After so many years I guess I ""outted"" myself as a person with depression finally on Facebook. I don't really feel better though, or worse."
DepressDiaries|You were given this life because you are strong enough to live it.
DepressDiaries|I can't sleep!!! Do I get up or continue laying in my bed miserable?? Someone help me....
DepressDiaries|And she became just what they said she would, worthless and alone.
DepressDiaries|Cutting is simply a question of power.
DepressDiaries|Finding Happiness Is The Greatest Of All Challenges
DepressDiaries|Life doesn't get any better, you just get used to it being this way and it seems like it does.
DepressDiaries|@ProdigalGlenn Alcohol destroyed my family. Please try and find it somewhere else, you deserve better.
DepressDiaries|You will always be the one who ruined my life.
DepressDiaries|Happiness is just a word to me.
DepressDiaries|"My reflection it's everything I hate,
Yet it's everything I am."
DepressDiaries|A young girls ambition, totally destroyed by a young girls vision.
DepressDiaries|"Lieing will kill you in the end,
Because at one moment, you start to drown in them..."
DepressDiaries|How is it that you can know me, when I don't even know myself?
DepressDiaries|I never trust anyone...least of all myself.
DepressDiaries|"Organs protected by the bones,
Bones protected by the skin,
Skin protected by the blade."
DepressDiaries|Why should I live if I hurt the ones I live for?
DepressDiaries|Cutting is like memories. Once it happens, the scars will always stay with you, and you will always remember why.
DepressDiaries|When will people understand that words can cut as sharply as any blade, and that those cuts leave scars upon our souls.
DepressDiaries|We do have one thing in common...we both hate me.
DepressDiaries|It's so hard to be tough when one way or another someone always makes you feel like you're not good enough.
DepressDiaries|"Isolated, Bruised, Broken, Torn, Crumbling, Lost, Alone, Cold, Invisible. 
Pick a name, they all mean me."
DepressDiaries|She says she doesn't care but the look in her eyes tell a completely different story.
DepressDiaries|These tears are stinging my eyes, but I won't let them fall.
DepressDiaries|Maybe if I were gorgeous, I would finally feel pretty...
DepressDiaries|"""Often the test of courage is not to die but to live."""
DepressDiaries|Shit happens. But mostly to me so don't worry.
DepressDiaries|It's not drowning I'm afraid of, it's this breathing that is taking all this work.
DepressDiaries|I'm very sorry for being me...but it's all I know.
DepressDiaries|"Don't ask me what is wrong only because I cry.
Don't think that I'm okay just because I smile."
DepressDiaries|"Love me
Hate me
Use me
Break me"
DepressDiaries|Forget me... it's that simple...
DepressDiaries|Wonder if I can be free without the pain?
DepressDiaries|My life is like an empty bottle, useful in many ways, but useless in many others.
DepressDiaries|"Hurtful words 
Endless fights
Burning tears
And restless nights
This is my life
Oh how I want to escape..."
DepressDiaries|If you knew how I felt, you wouldn't ask why I feel this way.
DepressDiaries|I have many hidden secrets...and many more hidden regrets.
DepressDiaries|You think I'm happy, but really I'm not...My smile must be the best lie I've got.
DepressDiaries|The fear of feeling won't let me cry for you.
DepressDiaries|"I miss the smile
I miss the laugh
I miss the life
I used to love"
DepressDiaries|For every whisper I hear, for every stare I see, you are all killing me a little more inside.
DepressDiaries|You put the darkness in me and now it won't come out.
DepressDiaries|I'm at a place so low I would give anything for the hope I might one day climb as high as rock bottom.
DepressDiaries|Speaking of that, I need a drink. Or 10.
DepressDiaries|I hate when people tell you in order to prevent a hangover don't drink. Wow, great idea Sherlock! Now tell me something that is useful.
DepressDiaries|You're not even supposed to drink the water in those countries but you're going to get butt implants? No, you're stupid.
DepressDiaries|People shouldn't be able to get their botched plastic surgery fixed for free if they were stupid enough to get it done in another country.
DepressDiaries|"Explain it to me,
This coldness
These glassy lost and lonely eyes
Explain why I feel so suffocated
Why everything makes me cry..."
DepressDiaries|"I'm having an identity crisis
I don't know who I am or what I used to be...
I need to be someone...
I just want to be me"
DepressDiaries|"Hiding who I am,
And how alone I feel,
My life amounting to nothing,
And I can’t cope and deal."
DepressDiaries|"She is just an innocent girl,
Destroyed by all the lies..."
DepressDiaries|"Dont look at my smile
--trust me its not real
when I tell you everything is okay
--trust me its not"
DepressDiaries|I'm exhausted, my foot is killing me, the inability to work out is driving me insane...there's only 1 remedy, online shopping.
DepressDiaries|I feel like I'm trapped in hell.
DepressDiaries|Seriously, I'd rather be dead than look the way I do.
DepressDiaries|I cannot stand being this fat anymore.
DepressDiaries|8 years ago today I brought home the love of my life. My cat has saved my life more times than I realize. I am so lucky &amp; thankful to God ❤

DepressDiaries|"I don't care what you think...
I don't care what you say...
Because I'm still gonna be this loser
Forever and always"
DepressDiaries|Life is a game...and I'm losing
DepressDiaries|Daddy...I don't understand what's so wrong with me....to make you not want me.
DepressDiaries|The ghosts from my past are haunting my future.
DepressDiaries|"Harder to speak, harder to hide. 
So much more locked inside."
DepressDiaries|So small, so worthless, and so easily sacrificed.
DepressDiaries|"You knew I was shattered,
I guess I never mattered"
DepressDiaries|I'm still trying to fly with these broken wings.
DepressDiaries|The scars will last forever...but nothing compares to the pain that put them there.
DepressDiaries|May is Mental Health Awareness Month!! Spread the word! #endthestigma http://t.co/05M1M1hScH
DepressDiaries|I hate Kristin Cavallari's ability to just keep popping out babies and still have a perfect body.
DepressDiaries|"I try.
I really do.
But something always goes wrong.
Taking me back into the dark hole."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes you have to fight back to let them know how much they made you miserable.
DepressDiaries|And she hates fearing the night because thats when she used to feel safe.
DepressDiaries|I'm not the person I once knew. I'm just an empty shell who goes through life so carelessly without one ounce of emotion toward anything.
DepressDiaries|Her smile remains strong... as her soul begins to weep.
DepressDiaries|If I can make them all believe it, maybe I'll believe it too.
DepressDiaries|"Hide the pain, Carry on.
Routine is key.
Don't let on that you're not,
What you're pretending to be."
DepressDiaries|My reflexion is a harsh truth.
DepressDiaries|If I had a dollar for every time I lost my remote I'd be a millionaire.
DepressDiaries|Happy Mother's Day Mom! If it weren't for u I would of died a long time ago. You never give up fighting for me. Thank you God. #blessed 💕💐🌷
DepressDiaries|Surgery today, I might be MIA for a bit. I'll be back as soon as I can. I love you all!! Stay strong (for me please!) xoxo
DepressDiaries|No matter how hard I try, I will never be okay.
DepressDiaries|"She was natures biggest mistake...
With a heart so broken and a smile so fake..."
DepressDiaries|No matter how many times she explains whats wrong no one will understand.
DepressDiaries|And I'm lying to myself...saying its for the best.
DepressDiaries|I wish I could shatter that image everyone else sees...
DepressDiaries|If beauty is truely only skin deep how far must I cut until my ugliness fades away.
DepressDiaries|Wonder if I can be free without the pain?
DepressDiaries|If only you could look through my eyes, then you would be able to see all my imperfections.
DepressDiaries|Welcome to my world...where being me, just isn't enough.
DepressDiaries|"Hurtful words 
Endless fights
Burning tears
And restless nights.
This is my life...
Oh how I want to escape..."
DepressDiaries|I reject your reality, and substitute my own.
DepressDiaries|"It's just a game
A game of pain
A game to leave you lost and insane"
DepressDiaries|If people could hear my thoughts would they act any differently?
DepressDiaries|I'm Alive Today Despite You, I'll Live Tommorrow To Spite You
DepressDiaries|I don't fear the dark anymore, because I have become part of the dark.
DepressDiaries|My worst fears are in my head...my biggest enemy is myself.
DepressDiaries|I'm at a place so low I would give anything for the hope I might one day climb as high as rock bottom.
DepressDiaries|We are the generation hand picked to bleed.
DepressDiaries|"Explain it to me...
This coldness,
These glassy lost and lonely eyes,
Explain why I feel so suffocated,
Why everything makes me cry."
DepressDiaries|"I'm having an identity crisis
i don't know who I am or who I used to be...
I need to be someone...
I just want to be me"
DepressDiaries|Life is a gift but its also a curse.
DepressDiaries|She knows she needs help she just doesnt want it...
DepressDiaries|The scariest person is the person who can see through your fake smile and to the truth...
DepressDiaries|Something instead of facing reality it's better to dream, because that way your heart stays in one piece.
DepressDiaries|Even the most beautiful of all roses...crumble to dust
DepressDiaries|Such a silly girl to lie about the life she lives, and such a sad one to wish didn't live at all.
DepressDiaries|I look above only to see all the angels plotting against me.
DepressDiaries|Behind this mask of a smile, is a tormented soul, just wanting to be put out of my misery.
DepressDiaries|"We cut to release pain
It works for a while..
Until we look back at our scars 
Then we remember why we did it &amp;
We are back at the beginning"
DepressDiaries|"Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see...
The devils of truth steal the souls of the free"
DepressDiaries|I've said a thousand prayers...and have spoken a million words...but still my voice has yet to be heard...
DepressDiaries|I help others because I can't help myself.
DepressDiaries|Looking at the beauty of the past, you realize the good was never meant to last.
DepressDiaries|Today I am thankful. Boyfriend &amp; I have been together 5 years. I have no idea why he hasn't left yet. Thank you God for this wonderful man ❤
DepressDiaries|I'm surprised I don't have like 15 children by now, considering how much life fucks me over.
DepressDiaries|Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer, but wish we didn't.
DepressDiaries|Scar tissue… It’s like a slipcover. It shields and disguises what’s beneath. That’s why we grow it; we have something to hide.
DepressDiaries|I fell so hard that I discovered there's not rock at the bottom...there's a deep ocean and I drowned.
DepressDiaries|And her problems don't seem to fade away after she cries.
DepressDiaries|"She's been everyone else's girl
Maybe someday she'll be her own"
DepressDiaries|It seems my demons have invited company for a party tonight. I wish they would turn down the music so I can sleep while they ruin my life.
DepressDiaries|How come when one thing goes wrong everything seems to follow?
DepressDiaries|"Are you pretty in pink or a little black dress?
The color I look best in is complete darkness."
DepressDiaries|Is it depression? Is it hate? Is it love? Or is this fate? Is it supposed to end? Continue like this? Is there anything in life to miss?
DepressDiaries|"She rejects your invitations, just to be alone
She stays to herself, so that her pain remains unknown"
DepressDiaries|Oh fuck, now the birds are awake.
DepressDiaries|"And yes, I'm being a whiny little bitch.
And yes, I'm entitled to once in a while."
DepressDiaries|I can't go 24 hrs w/o my migraine meds. We're talking pitch black room, face covered w/a pillow, dark tv &amp; still crying for my mommy pain.
DepressDiaries|My life revolves around over the counter meds. The only way I can sleep is by knocking myself out w/copious amounts of ZzzQuil every night!
DepressDiaries|I'm not allowed vitimins, supplements, asprin, herbal supplements, caffeine or any over the counter meds for 24hrs before blood work.
DepressDiaries|My doctor is a whore.
DepressDiaries|"Dear Body,
I do not love you.
I do not accept you.
I do not want to see you."
DepressDiaries|No, that's a lie. She just steals mine.
DepressDiaries|"Ohhh, my sister gave me a lot of her old clothes when I visited her. That's how we manage to keep things, we ""give"" them to each other."
DepressDiaries|I want to clean my room but I've run out of places to put things. I really don't know how I got so much stuff.
DepressDiaries|@_lostseeker_ Sometimes the positivity crap is absolute worst stuff for you! And the worst part is people don't understand that.
DepressDiaries|The first step in getting help is admitting you have a problem. To bad most people are in denial.
DepressDiaries|Death is too easy; life is too hard. That is why I am in the middle.
DepressDiaries|She was always so sad, but she never said a word. She just swallowed this feeling of loneliness, and smiled.
DepressDiaries|"She looks in the mirror and crys,
She is truly a sickening sight."
DepressDiaries|There is a beauty in my misery...
DepressDiaries|I look at my reflection each day, just to see if I can find someone I  actually like...
DepressDiaries|I really like self help books...until they want me to do something I don't want to, then I think they're crap.
DepressDiaries|"""Beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete.”"
DepressDiaries|"Losing control &amp; I cannot cope
All on my own, I dont have a hope
Feeling so lost, in this isolated world
The life that I had I cant rebuild"
DepressDiaries|"No life is easy,
But some are just harder."
DepressDiaries|Add me to your list of failures.
DepressDiaries|Hope is the noose with which we hang ourselves from the tree of Reality.
DepressDiaries|Im crying but tears dont flow from my eyes, everything is blurry, but theres nothing inside. I wonder if anyone will care if I died tonight.
DepressDiaries|Tired of getting up when all I do is fall down.
DepressDiaries|"This emptiness...
This hollow feeling…
It cannot be explained."
DepressDiaries|So why am I still waiting for this world to stop hating me?

DepressDiaries|Isn't it?? http://t.co/9KGlj3E8v6
DepressDiaries|It really is amazing... http://t.co/kbNvSHmFrV
DepressDiaries|There are two types of people http://t.co/7z5REJrN3K
DepressDiaries|The hardest question to answer http://t.co/XmcTnWSBlF

DepressDiaries|@___darkness__ Aww thank you so much! You have no idea what that means to me! 💖💖
DepressDiaries|@_KayyCee Priceless, especially if it was your boyfriend's mother or something equally awkward lol
DepressDiaries|"@_KayyCee Can you imagine if someone complimented your make up &amp; asked what kind it was, ""Oh, it's an orgasm and deep throat combination."" 😂"
DepressDiaries|@_KayyCee I didn't see those! I still think Deep Throat is still the worst of the three lol
DepressDiaries|"Am I the only one who finds it a bit disturbing that Nars has an eyeshadow and blush kit called ""Deep Throat?"""
DepressDiaries|Is 5pm to early to go to bed?
DepressDiaries|"Bartender, Pass Me A Drink,
I Just Don't Want To Think."
DepressDiaries|Broken dreams...silent screams...dead soul...fake smile...unliveable life...
DepressDiaries|I am everything I hate.
DepressDiaries|Fairy tails don't exist, Dreams are meant for sleeping, and Wishes never come true.
DepressDiaries|Everytime I see myself, there's always something wrong with me...
DepressDiaries|"The question, ""Do you need help?"" Is another way of saying, ""I feel sorry for you."""
DepressDiaries|What's the point in trying if you're seen as a failure?
DepressDiaries|"My life has been a nightmare, my soul is fractured to the bone. 
And if I must be lonely, I think I'd rather be alone."
DepressDiaries|"Don't lose yourself because they don't want the real you,
Lose yourself because you can't handle the real you"
DepressDiaries|And She Finally Locked Herself Away From the World
DepressDiaries|Trying to peice together the last bit of hope I have left.
DepressDiaries|Tears are a language only the lost can understand
DepressDiaries|"Maybe it's too late for me. 
Maybe there's no going back. 
Maybe I can't be saved. 
Maybe it's all going black."
DepressDiaries|"Call me what you want
Laugh, point, or stare
Whatever makes you feel better;
Whatever makes your pathetic life easier to bare"
DepressDiaries|Life hates me...need I say more
DepressDiaries|All these tears turn into scars and all these scars turn into covered up lies.
DepressDiaries|She hates who she is...but she doesn't want to change...
DepressDiaries|"My favorite is, ""Uhhh...Why are you crying?"" Because you just said something that upset me you dumbass!"
DepressDiaries|I don't understand men. They're not from a different planet, they're from a whole freaking different galaxy!
DepressDiaries|I have to have surgery on my foot in May. So that's at least a month until I'll be able to run etc. Fuck, I probably will shoot myself.
DepressDiaries|I hate being fat. I might as well be dead.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes the most painful thing can be looking in a mirror.
DepressDiaries|"This girl loves and knows everyone,
Except herself."
DepressDiaries|Just want to cry and let it all out, but it feels like someone is always watching.
DepressDiaries|@skinnyislife1 @skinnyanorexic Fight as hard as you can to keep that person. Our experiences don't define us. How we deal with them does.
DepressDiaries|Life is not meant to be fair.
DepressDiaries|Life is not meant to be easy.
DepressDiaries|If I had one last chance to look into your eyes I'd pour all my pain into them so you could see how much pain you put me through.
DepressDiaries|Shattered wings. Shaded tears. Unwilling to be forgotten.
DepressDiaries|My life has been a nightmare, my soul is fractured to the bone. And if I must be lonely, I think I'd rather be alone.
DepressDiaries|"My lies can't save me,
And neither can you,
That's something I will have to do."
DepressDiaries|The way he looks up at the night sky, you'd think he's expecting to find hope among the stars.
DepressDiaries|I am lost and all I have is you to blame for that.
DepressDiaries|To exist for no reason is the same as being dead.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes....no most of the time....lies are easier to take than the truth.
DepressDiaries|There are endless reasons never to share yourself again.
DepressDiaries|"Don't lose yourself because they don't want the real you,

Lose yourself because you can't handle the real you"
DepressDiaries|Theres a beauty in my misery...
DepressDiaries|I just wanted a story...you weren't supposed to be nice.
DepressDiaries|"Is it okay to say ""Thats what she said"" to the future King of England? 😂 Because that shits going on my bucket list!"
DepressDiaries|I mean if I were her age with 3 kids in their 20s I'd dress that way too. But I don't a country watching me.
DepressDiaries|So I finally started watching The Royals and they way overdid the Queen. She dresses to sexy, her face doesn't move, she's not believable.
DepressDiaries|Differernt Day, Same Shit.
DepressDiaries|The reasons I push you away are the same reasons why I cry.
DepressDiaries|She hates who she is...but she doesn't want to change...
DepressDiaries|You hate liars, because you're terrified they'll figure out your secrets...after all they're the only ones who could.
DepressDiaries|@skinnyanorexic I love you sugar! Stay strong! ❤
DepressDiaries|"Perhaps instead of guys pointing out a girls PMS, they should say ""Thank you not carrying my baby right now."" and then get you a present."
DepressDiaries|That's okay, sleep isn't really important for living anyway.
DepressDiaries|Just when you thought you've lost everything, you find out you can lose a little more.
DepressDiaries|Today I looked in the mirror and thought to myself, how come someone can be in so much pain and nobody even notices?
DepressDiaries|Did the Duchess have that baby yet??
DepressDiaries|No expression none at all I brace myself as I fall I'll never beat this battle no matter how hard I try My mind &amp; body just want me to die
DepressDiaries|For you eating is a habit, for me its one hell of a chore
DepressDiaries|The way you kiss me makes me think that your trying to suffocate and kill us both, so we can be free from this hell hole.
DepressDiaries|It's not about whether or not life is worth the pain; but whether or not death is worth missing out on everything else.
DepressDiaries|You can wipe away make up..,you can clean off dirt...but nothing can hide the scars or erase the past that haunts your life...
DepressDiaries|"There's no once upon a time
There's no perfect timing
There's no happy ending"
DepressDiaries|"I'm afraid to be alone.
Not because I won't know what to do,
But because I know what I will do."
DepressDiaries|"Flashbacks
Streaks of pain
A river of tears 
I've taken an overdose of my mind"
DepressDiaries|"My friends ask me to stop hurting myself
But I tell them once you feel the pain I feel you would want to hurt yourself too..."
DepressDiaries|Slit my wrists with your words, and I will apologize for bleeding on your shirt.
DepressDiaries|There is, perhaps, no greater loss than the loss of hope.
DepressDiaries|The sad part is, I've been gone for way to long, I'm not even sure who I am anymore...
DepressDiaries|Some people's past is behind them, mine is on my wrist.
DepressDiaries|Staring into the mirror at my reflection I close my eyes –daring to look at the person even I don't recognize.
DepressDiaries|I've spent nights curled up in the dark, laying on the floor, telling myself over and over that I am loved just so that I won't end it.
DepressDiaries|I am everything I hate.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes you just have to run away to see who follows.
DepressDiaries|"You bleed to know you're alive,
I bleed because I wish I wasn't"
DepressDiaries|Please don't try to bring me down, I'm already way down on the ground, and if you try to build me up, I'll just have further to fall.
DepressDiaries|I can tell you in one, exact word whats hurting me: everything.
DepressDiaries|She needs to hear she's beautiful, so tell her this just once, but make her believe that she is, make her believe she is enough.
DepressDiaries|"She looks in the mirror and crys,
She is truly a sickening sight."
DepressDiaries|I'm holding onto something that used to be there, hoping it will come back, knowing it won't.
DepressDiaries|You never know when you wake up, if all will be the same, or if you'll be back in your dark place, again to feel the pain.
DepressDiaries|Apologies are nothing but a collection of meaningless words.
DepressDiaries|And I'm still waiting for that emptiness in my heart to be filled...
DepressDiaries|She locked herself within a wall of sadness, and her sadness soon turned into madness.
DepressDiaries|"Dreaming of death but afraid to die.
It makes perfect sense to her."
DepressDiaries|Betrayed and broken by people I loved and trusted. Well screw you too. You're already erased from my memory.
DepressDiaries|"She laughs because it's what is expected
She smiles so no one will worry
She pretends so no one will ask"
DepressDiaries|Why is it that when you pour your heart out no one seems to care?
DepressDiaries|A broken heart can heal, but a broken soul never does.
DepressDiaries|Screw this, I'm taking tomorrow off from life.
DepressDiaries|Is Facebook going to cancel my account if I don't have an engagement ring or sonogram picture on there soon?
DepressDiaries|Good times
DepressDiaries|"And then a person is creepy and asks you what you take and you're like ""No, I said I COULD. I didn't say I DO."""
DepressDiaries|"Or when you tell someone you can't remember &amp; they're Shocked &amp; you're like ""I could run a fucking pharmacy how am I supposed to remember?"""
DepressDiaries|"When you can't remember if you took your medicine and it's one of the important ones so you can't just be like ""Eh, it's almost tomorrow."""
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Yea...except it isn't. Hell, I probably would of asked anyway, I'm the Queen of Depression not Ms. Manners.
DepressDiaries|I'm just going to grin and bear it.
DepressDiaries|"This emptiness...
This hollow feeling…
It cannot be explained."
DepressDiaries|Desperate to feel sane, be normal once more, but my life's just a game, that can't be ignored.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes it's better to be alone, just so you can't hurt anyone with your pain...
DepressDiaries|"Shadowed by my own embrace,
Hiding beneath this mask,
No one can see how close death truly creeps"
DepressDiaries|I can't ask for help through the choking tears that I'm trying to swallow.
DepressDiaries|Who is braver: The one who kills themself to excape the cruelty of life, or the one who lives through it?
DepressDiaries|Isn't it weird how the cuts only hurt for awhile yet the pain never seems to go away.
DepressDiaries|What about when you've pretended for so long, that the facade becomes a part of you...
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Because I hate to tell you, someday that will no longer be true.
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico How old are you?
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico You're really making a wonderful representation for your gender with that one.
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico I know right! I need to patent that before some asshole steals it!!
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico My subconscious totally did that because he's irritating me and I wish my phone had an where you could slap somebody
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Hahaha oops that's funny. I meant main.
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Yea, I already got his pain present. But now I need a sentimental one. Those are not easy.
DepressDiaries|I think of things, and then I feel like, No he's a guy, that's not a present he would want. This is tough stuff man.
DepressDiaries|I need something thoughtful to get boyfriend for our anniversary. Helppppppp Meeeeee Pleaseeeeee
DepressDiaries|You know you're having a really bad day when even Pinterest pisses you off.
DepressDiaries|Please help me raise money for TWOLA!! You guy most of all know how important these organizations are. https://t.co/62P2vKT4fW
DepressDiaries|It's right now and I can't fight it.
DepressDiaries|It's when I want to leave so bad.
DepressDiaries|It's when I pretend the most.
DepressDiaries|It's the times I hurt to much that I cannot say.
DepressDiaries|It's the times I need you most, that I pull away.
DepressDiaries|Each day of madness keeps us tied down. Forcing us to endure the despair of reality, and making us stay sane.
DepressDiaries|And you know, it hurts...but I'll live another tomorrow...
DepressDiaries|My life is a joke.
DepressDiaries|Oh, a migraine. That's lovely.
DepressDiaries|Okay, that's a lie. I would have drank less though.
DepressDiaries|And this is completely boyfriends fault. If I knew he was going to decide to take me home early so he could study I wouldnt have even drank!
DepressDiaries|Ugh... I'm going to have a hangover tomorrow. I hate getting old.
DepressDiaries|It's time for a margarita.....or 5.
DepressDiaries|And what are we 12?? Say what you need to say to me, not your entire facebook feed, who by the way, don't care.
DepressDiaries|Don't make your facebook status about me and then delete my comment.
DepressDiaries|"""Secrets don't get better with time."" -Dr. Phil
Not gonna lie Dr. Phil, I expect more than stating the obvious from you."
DepressDiaries|If each of my followers donated $1 to my TWOLA run, that would be some serious cash that would actually make a difference to so many people!
DepressDiaries|"Please Donate!!!
https://t.co/62P2vKBtoo"
DepressDiaries|@skinnyanorexic I know you didn't want to go so I'm really proud of you that you did!! 💕💗
DepressDiaries|"You know you have a really good therapist when she texts you ""Bite me"" quickly followed by ""What would you do if I was a normal counselor?"""
DepressDiaries|"Read this article if you're a People-Pleaser

DepressDiaries|"Read this article if you're a People-Pleaser

DepressDiaries|"My horoscope says, ""Don't try to herd cats today."" Umm....what?"
DepressDiaries|@glamngloom_e Very true! I have a crappy diet though... Oops lol
DepressDiaries|A 5K is only 3 miles. You could walk it and I'm sure no one would arrest you for breach of charity fundraiser rules.
DepressDiaries|So if you want to join a team and virtually run a 5K on April 18th for TWOLA. Then favorite this tweet. There is a sign up fee I believe.
DepressDiaries|"It's also possible to form a team. You would run ""virtually."" Which means around city on ur treadmill, I don't think the place matters alot."
DepressDiaries|TWOLA is doing a 5K on April 18th. If u favorite this tweet that means you will support me through fundraising. If enough of you do, I will!
DepressDiaries|@deityzyhra Oh, well there's @TWLOHA which I love.
DepressDiaries|@deityzyhra Nope, sorry love. Only other thing I can think of is support groups in your local area or schools/colleges.
DepressDiaries|@UnbreakableIzMe You can DM me if you have more questions
DepressDiaries|@UnbreakableIzMe Ur brain needs omega-3 just to function completely. A decrease in ur omega-3, leaves u more vulnerable to depression, etc
DepressDiaries|@Nasir_xy Umm...Oops my bad
DepressDiaries|Your brain is made up of mostly fat &amp; if ur not getting enough omega in ur daily food intake, then ur brain seriously needs that supplement.
DepressDiaries|And I know many of you have parents who are against, well everything. Omega-3 is just like the multivitamin you should also be taking daily.
DepressDiaries|They can be a huge help with most mental illnesses. Some studies show people are able to eventually get off meds just by taking Omega-3.
DepressDiaries|If you have depression, on medication or not, you should also be taking an Omega-3 fatty acid supplement.
DepressDiaries|My sister ordered coffee bean extract pills. Any better diet pills?? #replytweet
DepressDiaries|Wtf is happening to my life?
DepressDiaries|I really don't feel like being sober right now.
DepressDiaries|Not any of you btw, just the annoying people I see in real life
DepressDiaries|I'M SO TIRED OF FIXING EVERYONE ELSE'S PROBLEMS WHILE THEY JUST IGNORE MINE!!!
DepressDiaries|I wish I were tall. Being short and fat sucks.
DepressDiaries|There's nothing in nature that freezes your heart more than realizing that you're meant to be alone.
DepressDiaries|The memories bring back the past, and the pain makes it real again.
DepressDiaries|The make up isn’t just to hide what's on the outside, it's to cover up the insecurities I hold on the inside.
DepressDiaries|"I hate to complain,
Or say everything is not okay.
But I'm praying to you,
To help me find my way."
DepressDiaries|I've been broken before...I know what it feels like to see something funny and not laugh.
DepressDiaries|"Tears falling from my eyes 
What have I become 
I'm living a lie..."
DepressDiaries|I love to hate, and hate to love.
DepressDiaries|Tears are a language only the lost can understand.
DepressDiaries|My fake smile is starting to hurt on the outside as much as it hurts on the inside.
DepressDiaries|"Call me what you want
Laugh, point, or stare
Whatever makes you feel better;
Whatever makes your pathetic life easier to bare"
DepressDiaries|No words can ever explain, this mixture of happiness and pain.
DepressDiaries|"There is no risk of losing...
If everything has already fallen."
DepressDiaries|Life hates me...need I say more?
DepressDiaries|I wear a mask to hide myself from the world, if they knew the real me, they would hate me more than ever.
DepressDiaries|She hates who she is...but she doesn't want to change...
DepressDiaries|Hello lovely pink walls and beautiful accent pieces that men believe are completely pointless!
DepressDiaries|Thank God for screenshots because now I have solid proof I can decorate our bedroom whichever way makes me happiest when the time comes.
DepressDiaries|The best part is when you're the youngest and it's like having a 3rd parent.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I honestly cant understand how 2 people, with the same parents, raised in the same house w/the same rules can end up so different.
DepressDiaries|Animal or human, neither life is worth more than the other.
DepressDiaries|Btw, I'm totally against animals being put down unless it is truly in their best interest. Like a human on life support.
DepressDiaries|Holy freaking migraine!! I feel like a horse that should be put down.
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Please, your probably an infant. And you don't bounce until you puke, puking in there is forbidden. Afterwards u can jump.
DepressDiaries|I feel like waking away from a nice pair of heels that are on sale for $9.99 is just wrong; like leaving a cat out in rain, it's just wrong!
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico I'm getting old, I can't drink like I used too. Although the bouncy house may be very enjoyable when I'm finished puking.
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico 1tequila, 2 tequila, 3 tequila, Floor
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Of??
DepressDiaries|No one can hurt you more than those who share your blood.
DepressDiaries|"It's simple.
I'm a girl that can't handle all the pain."
DepressDiaries|You have to hit rock bottom before you can ever be on top.
DepressDiaries|I don't do excuses, I don't ask why, it's just a breakdown, it happens all the time.
DepressDiaries|Just when you thought you've lost everything, you find out you can lose a little more.
DepressDiaries|My favorite part of the Kardashians is watching them fight/bicker like normal sisters but its like over something worth millions of dollars.
DepressDiaries|@NotADiagnosis Tell me how to fast forward to tomorrow? 😊
DepressDiaries|Well today is turning into a shit fest faster than expected.
DepressDiaries|You can paint yourself up nice and pretty, but it won't change how much you hate yourself.
DepressDiaries|"She lives a nightmare everyday,
Just hoping she'll awake.
She wants to be free and live again,
Shes sick of being fake..."
DepressDiaries|I walked away not to make you feel bad or to follow me; but so that I could suffer alone.
DepressDiaries|"Have you ever wanted to just freeze frame one moment in your life, and say, ""This just isn't me."""
DepressDiaries|And I feel like...I'm living the worst day over and over again.
DepressDiaries|I don't know many things, but I do know that a little bit of sadness can quickly turn into a lot of madness.
DepressDiaries|Being fat is destroying my life
DepressDiaries|Why am I awake this early?
DepressDiaries|You can't fix me, I am who I am. Face the fact.
DepressDiaries|All the times I've cried are symbols of all the times I tried but failed.
DepressDiaries|The worst bit about pushing someone away is when they just go without looking back.
DepressDiaries|Erasing the past only leads to rewriting the pain.
DepressDiaries|@KelseyJay15 I already am following you.
DepressDiaries|Sorry, I'm tired. That's why nothing makes sense! lol
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I go awhile without checking twitter &amp; I don't keep it on my phone. But no one is ever purposely ignored or even just ignored lol
DepressDiaries|Guys, please know I'm always here for you. Just send a DM or and I'll reply as soon as I see it. xoxo
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Eh there are accts way bigger but I care about all my followers. I'll always talk to them as soon as I can. Just DM/tweet.
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Thank you!!! You're so sweet!! 💕💗
DepressDiaries|How does every word that anyone says no matter what it is, good or bad only intensify the pain even more?
DepressDiaries|"All I did was love you
All you did was watch me fall"
DepressDiaries|I'm not okay. You're not okay. And that's okay.
DepressDiaries|Why must you push me down, when I'm already on the floor.
DepressDiaries|@Getting_Deeper Love you more💕💗
DepressDiaries|She makes me feel so small and unimportant. Not intentionally. She has just worked hard &amp; been successful. I've done nothing. I am nothing.
DepressDiaries|I need to remove my lower ribs. Eh, they're probably not very important anyway.
DepressDiaries|My sister found this hysterical. I did not.
DepressDiaries|My sister has a really tiny waist and last time I was trying on a dress of hers and it wouldn't zip up the back because of my ribcage.
DepressDiaries|My sister's coming home....I already feel fat enough
DepressDiaries|It's amazing the memories and feelings a simple tree falling over can dig up.
DepressDiaries|I love the show Catfish. My favorite part is when one person asks the other if they're a catfish and they just lie and say No 😂
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Thanks for even noticing. 💜
DepressDiaries|How did I ever get this broken?
DepressDiaries|"I'm out of control spiraling down,
I don't want help so I don't make a sound."
DepressDiaries|"I'm left all alone in this secretive world,
All of the thoughts in my mind are swirled."
DepressDiaries|"Lonely and forgotten.
Incomplete and sad.
Slowly losing sanity.
Slowly going mad."
DepressDiaries|What would you do if the world gave up on you?
DepressDiaries|Loving your happiness in a bottle of alcohol more than you love your depressed daughter. #daddy
DepressDiaries|I hide my scars because you don't have the right to know the trick to life.
DepressDiaries|Why did I cut, you ask. Because it feels so damn good to feel alive.
DepressDiaries|Whats the point of trying when you fail everytime?
DepressDiaries|Either way, awake or not.. I'm still in a nightmare.
DepressDiaries|"And she's so scared to get close to anyone because everyone that ever said ""I'll be there,"" ""Left..."""
DepressDiaries|You become an expert on your own body as you slowly destroy it.
DepressDiaries|When your depression is so bad it manifests into physical pain.
DepressDiaries|Goodnight Moon
DepressDiaries|Do I bring me pain or do they?
DepressDiaries|Am I still living, I don't even know anymore? It all seems to hurt everywhere, no matter where you are.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes surviving is all the living I can do.
DepressDiaries|All those silent tears she cries at night, will force her to do things she never thought about doing...
DepressDiaries|"I try to find myself
I find the stranger trapped inside
And I'll take one more step away
From the face I used to recognize"
DepressDiaries|Tears are like words; they have to come out sometime.
DepressDiaries|Even now, a very small mistake can drag me down as much as any other can.
DepressDiaries|It's not about whether or not life is worth the pain; But whether or not death is worth missing out on everything else.
DepressDiaries|When you love someone, you want to believe they're good.
DepressDiaries|How can you crave to be alone and yet alone is the only thing you ever feel?
DepressDiaries|Pain...to much to handle, but not enough to give up
DepressDiaries|"Death stumps her,
Rape continues to rattle her,
Visions conquer her,
Blades cut her,
Numbness take over her,
Can anyone save her?"
DepressDiaries|I could drown in a ocean of things I'll never say.
DepressDiaries|Its a brand new day....and for a few seconds, all the pain goes away.
DepressDiaries|"I stare at nothing 
Wondering how it got to this
How I ended up using drugs 
And slitting my wrist"
DepressDiaries|There is no greater agony than bearing an unwritten story inside of you.
DepressDiaries|Or maybe football is just football. And boyfriend is wrong, of course. :)
DepressDiaries|I guess what Im saying is maybe God does give the hardest lives to his toughest soldiers Maybe we're here to be great, possibly even history
DepressDiaries|--in our brains. His, healthy Mine, depressed. I could check out of this life anytime, but he doesnt get those same urges, hes here to stay.
DepressDiaries|---the chance to possibly be a part of history, his mind didn't change. All this made me wonder if our decisions are based on difference---
DepressDiaries|I said they're sissys. He said he'd gladly retire with his fit &amp; health &amp; money. Even when questioned about the opportunity to be great ---
DepressDiaries|Boyfriend &amp; I are talking about football &amp; how recently many players retired before age 29 because doctors are concerned about head injuries
DepressDiaries|I Rather Be Invisible, Then To Allow You To See A Failure In Me
DepressDiaries|"She Smiles Like She's So Tough..,
Stands Tall Like She's Really Happy...
But, Beneath it all...
She Knows She Will Never Be Happy Again."
DepressDiaries|Her Own Thoughts Turned Against Her
DepressDiaries|Every now and then I get tired of listening to the sound of my own tears.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes, you've got to get fucked up to feel sober, cry to see clear and fall a hundred times to learn how to pick yourself back up again.
DepressDiaries|"The blade touches my skin with the care of a lover...
And I fall into pain's embrace..."
DepressDiaries|If I close my eyes now, I'm not sure if I'll want to open them again.
DepressDiaries|"I promised you I wouldn't,
But this feeling of death is haunting me.
I must see that blood,
To know I am still alive..."
DepressDiaries|Do you enjoy lifting me up, just to watch me fall?
DepressDiaries|I can't live like this anymore.
DepressDiaries|@amashiraterasu I got up. I'm not sure how long it will last though.
DepressDiaries|Lay in bed with hope of eventually sleeping? Or get up an do something??
DepressDiaries|I hurt in places I'll never let you see.
DepressDiaries|My tired and broken heart just can't take anymore.
DepressDiaries|I don't know who I am anymore.
DepressDiaries|We are all too young to have to feel like this.
DepressDiaries|"They say time has way of healing, or so they say.
So why am I still left here crying?"
DepressDiaries|@Empress_Noelle I know. It really sucks.
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico idk, it's just a saying lol
DepressDiaries|@Empress_Noelle I did once. My psychiatrist is a dumbass who forgot I hated being fat. Thats why Im so scared, I cant go through that again!
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico I'd say created a monster, but I already was one.
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico That's okay, I can torture from afar!!
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Well if I gain weight then yes, you should be incredibly worried! I don't joke about being fat.
DepressDiaries|@BrooklynDeniseK I mean, I guess bigger boobs never hurt anyone... lol
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Oh don't worry! I will!! :)
DepressDiaries|@bxyondrxpair Thank you love!!
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico I hope you're right!!
DepressDiaries|@CharlieClassico Sweetie, physically active or not, it's always a concern!!
DepressDiaries|@skinnycalipop Birth control gave you pregnancy symptoms lol That must of really sucked!
DepressDiaries|@nobodycankn0w I was last week! I literally spend the whole week in bed. So like Im losing a week of life once a month, which is ridiculous.
DepressDiaries|@Empress_Noelle Me too. But I also think it depends a lot on the person. I can't gain weight, it will make me more depressed.
DepressDiaries|Did birth control ever increase your weight?? #replytweet
DepressDiaries|I need help from my girls! My Dr wants to put me on birth control to help my depression during pms. I'm terrified it will make me fat!!!
DepressDiaries|I don't understand how anyone could love me.
DepressDiaries|"I hate this feeling of being lost,
With nobody around to help ease the pain"
DepressDiaries|Admitting you're hurt can be harder than being hurt.
DepressDiaries|The world keeps changing yet I stand still.
DepressDiaries|I'm to worthless to even succeed at quitting.
DepressDiaries|All I do is ache, I can't find any peace of mind.
DepressDiaries|Well life was fun for awhile.. Can I be done now?
DepressDiaries|How did I ever get this broken?
DepressDiaries|"Lonely and forgotten.
Incomplete and sad.
Slowly losing sanity.
Slowly going mad."
DepressDiaries|My family means everything to me, but I mean nothing to them.
DepressDiaries|"I've stopped caring.
Even about the things that used to make me smile."
DepressDiaries|I've come to terms with my numbness. It may stay as long as it doesn't kill my soul.
DepressDiaries|"No one understands the perfection I seek, 
And no one hears the words I speak. 
Hating my reflection every day"
DepressDiaries|Just close your eyes and pretend I'm the pretty girl you really want.
DepressDiaries|"Flashbacks
Streaks of pain
A river of tears 
I've taken an overdose of my mind"
DepressDiaries|So tired of this all
DepressDiaries|My cell phone is smarter than me. I'm not sure how I feel about that.
DepressDiaries|@UnbreakableIzMe I was going to get that but then I caved and got the Galaxy 5
DepressDiaries|Yes!! I'm watching criminal minds again. If you have a problem with it, uhh bite me. 😊
DepressDiaries|Its a shame society keeps telling boys they need to be jocks. No way! Give me the kid in the library who grows up to look like Spencer Reid!
DepressDiaries|All I needed, was to be wanted, was that too much to ask?
DepressDiaries|Even though you are here for me I feel as if I facing things alone…
DepressDiaries|Don't worry about me, in the end I'll be fine, I'm just the girl forgotten, the girl left behind.
DepressDiaries|"The Point...
Where it all becomes so numb."
DepressDiaries|I don't fear life...I fear those who are in it...
DepressDiaries|"Count your lucky stars,
Before they fade away..."
DepressDiaries|Does that make me a bad person? Probably
DepressDiaries|I'm not going to lie, I'm looking forward to see which marriages make it and which ones don't.
DepressDiaries|I freaking hate facebook.
DepressDiaries|Obviously, I am doing something wrong with my life.
DepressDiaries|Everyone on my Facebook feed is either expecting a baby or just had one. Or they just got engaged or are having their wedding this summer.
DepressDiaries|Nothing makes us so lonely as our secrets.
DepressDiaries|What did we do to deserve a life of the first one?
DepressDiaries|And ones that have nothing wrong, simple problems and everything is easy for them.
DepressDiaries|Ones with bad lives, depression, tragedies in the making.
DepressDiaries|There are two people;
DepressDiaries|"Each second that passes by
The pain keeps growing deep inside
Every minute that I'm still alive
I hope with all my strength to just die"
DepressDiaries|Stick and stones may scar my skin.. but words slice right through my soul within.
DepressDiaries|Your words are careless yet they mean so much...
DepressDiaries|When will there be a smile on my face that isn't a lie?
DepressDiaries|"Pretend I'm okay.
Only to lie another day."
DepressDiaries|"So far from where I started from,
So far from where I want to be."
DepressDiaries|Fat as fuck trumps tired as fuck
DepressDiaries|@rofuckingie Sometimes it is everything. But this time it's something I just can't put my finger on.
DepressDiaries|It's driving me insane!!!!!
DepressDiaries|Ever have something bothering you but you can't figure out exactly what it is?
DepressDiaries|"Help!!
Android G2 went to phone heaven.
What should I get now -besides iPhone- &amp; something easy pls w/good camera. Thank you! #replytweet"
DepressDiaries|Watching The Little Mermaid and my mom changes the channel to watch The Antique's Road Show. Wtf??
DepressDiaries|The Little Mermaid is starting!!!!
DepressDiaries|Give me a bottle, I want to get so drunk I forget who I am...
DepressDiaries|Will give anything for the artificial happiness which momentarily makes her forget the pain she feels.
DepressDiaries|She was a smart girl until she fell in love.
DepressDiaries|"ABC Family Tonight
The Little Mermaid - 7
Sleeping Beauty - 8:45
Cinderella - 10:30
Pocahontas - 12:15am
#yourewelcome"
DepressDiaries|Without love we are incomplete, and at the mercy of others to help us find it.
DepressDiaries|You don't know how many times I lie about how I really feel.
DepressDiaries|No, I don't cry on the outside anymore.
DepressDiaries|Life is like a box of chocolates- it's a cheap thoughtless perfectionary gift that nobody ever asks for.
DepressDiaries|If it wasn't for you I would have done worse to myself...
DepressDiaries|Everything happens for a reason. I just need something to believe in.
DepressDiaries|I spend all my time trying to fix what's wrong in my life instead of actually living it.
DepressDiaries|I'm the prettiest train wreck you'll ever see.
DepressDiaries|"I promised I'd be happy,
I didn't mean to tell a lie.
But the moment I faked that smile,
All I did was die."
DepressDiaries|There's only so much a girl like me can take, so please forgive me if I break...
DepressDiaries|"Never asking for a second chance..
Because all that awaits, is failure."
DepressDiaries|Why is saying you need help so hard but writing it down is so easy?
DepressDiaries|When pain starts to make you feel alive.. you know you've crossed the point of no return.
DepressDiaries|The only one who understands me, lives in my mirror.
DepressDiaries|She's been stuck in this stereotype of a girl who's always happy and never does anything wrong.
DepressDiaries|There's a good side to getting hurt a lot...after a while it just doesn't bother you as much.
DepressDiaries|You remind me of the time, when I once knew who I was...
DepressDiaries|It's kind of amazing really, how my own words do such a good job of destroying me.
DepressDiaries|Who needs knives; I've got the last words you said to me... and they're as sharp as ever.
DepressDiaries|The screaming in my head must be a sign I've held on too long.
DepressDiaries|Maybe in a perfect world, she would feel beautiful.
DepressDiaries|She's a girl with no future, and barely a past.
DepressDiaries|Hiding depression by hiding myself.
DepressDiaries|I don't sit in silence because I like it...I sit in silence because it's safe.
DepressDiaries|I lock reality out of the room, and sit in a peaceful solitude that doesn't exist.
DepressDiaries|Life is a world of endless pain that kills us within the beauty of our souls...
DepressDiaries|"Lips Don't Smile Without A Thought.
Tears Don't Fall Without A Reason."
DepressDiaries|"Bright, twinkling stars,
Tell me what you see...
Do you think there is
A vacant space up there for me?"
DepressDiaries|An everlasting sleep is what I truly need...so all these thoughts inside of me can no longer breed.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes, it's not easy to let go &amp; forget; because seeing the person who hurt you, means scratching the scar &amp; letting it bleed once more.
DepressDiaries|She feels like somehow someone always finds a way to bring her down. Shes never good enough for anyway &amp; they all just see right through her
DepressDiaries|The Body Heals, But The Heart Remembers All The Pain
DepressDiaries|It's my pain. My pain. This is private. This is personal. These memories are mine. This pain is mine. It's my secret.
DepressDiaries|You should know by now not to leave her alone. She is only going to be tortured by the dark, loneliness &amp; a thousand images of friends lost.
DepressDiaries|"I'm sick of the loneliness
I'm sick of the sadness
When will it ever be over??"
DepressDiaries|I can't do this on my own anymore. My strength is fading, and my mask is cracking and breaking.
DepressDiaries|"Forget who you are...... 
Remember who you were.....
Which do you prefer?"
DepressDiaries|Please forgive me for not being pretty.
DepressDiaries|You’re killing me slowly, yet you’re the one thing keeping me alive…
DepressDiaries|"You can take the blade from her hand
But you can't take the pain from her heart"
DepressDiaries|When you feel like giving up...Remember why you held on...
DepressDiaries|Everyone keeps telling me, stop saying ur sorry, stop apologizing! I'm sorry but I dont know how to live a life without always saying sorry!
DepressDiaries|"My scars with eventually go away,
But I have to deal with my pain day by day"
DepressDiaries|I just want to bury my memories but no one will let me.
DepressDiaries|"As a child I fought not to sleep
As a teen I slept to escape
As an adult I sleep to die"
DepressDiaries|There are only 3 people in this world of ours that know how I really feel, me, myself and I.
DepressDiaries|"You haven't felt this pain
You haven't suffered like this
You haven't been depressed
So don't tell me you understand"
DepressDiaries|Behind these eyes full of tears, is a girl that wants to shine.
DepressDiaries|Have you ever felt as if no matter how much you reach out to someone they won't grab your hand...
DepressDiaries|As long as I can still fake a smile and hold back a tear, I'm okay.
DepressDiaries|The only problem with me is that I am the problem.
DepressDiaries|I like life, just not mine.
DepressDiaries|She wraps her arms around her knees, and she whispers why me?
DepressDiaries|I’m scared because I’m falling and I know you’re not there to catch me.
DepressDiaries|"Mirror mirror lie to me...
Show me what I want see"
DepressDiaries|"Just a few kind words could save her.
Just a few more unkind words could kill her."
DepressDiaries|"Physically shes ok....
Mentally shes been beaten, battered and tortured."
DepressDiaries|Believing a lie is so much easier than facing the truth.
DepressDiaries|There is no love that I can see...even from the own hands that created me.
DepressDiaries|"Trying so hard to hold herself together...
Shards of her heart as fragile as a feather..."
DepressDiaries|@hamour_ba7rani You're so sweet!!
DepressDiaries|@hamour_ba7rani No!! lol Definitely not a ginger!!
DepressDiaries|@hamour_ba7rani haha Thank you! xoxo
DepressDiaries|@hamour_ba7rani Yes...is that okay? lol
DepressDiaries|"Take a look, what do you see
A ghost in the corner, or is it me?
You walk by like you don't even care
You must be blind not to see I'm there"
DepressDiaries|Happy St. Patrick's Day!!! There is nothing better than being an Irish girl!! 🍀🍻
DepressDiaries|Depression is when you don't remember how to cry or how to just breathe but do both anyway.
DepressDiaries|i cannot be lost, because I've never been found.
DepressDiaries|Don't fall into the trap of pretending everything's fine when you know it isn't.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I forget. Thank you for being there to remind me of exactly how worthless I am.
DepressDiaries|I'm fair from okay but thats just fine, go ahead and live your life...after all, you cant break a broken girl...
DepressDiaries|I'm not a backup plan and definitely not a second choice.
DepressDiaries|So many tears I can't see the lies so many lies I can't see the truth
DepressDiaries|I am nothing more than Fake Smiles and Beautiful Scars
DepressDiaries|Somewhere in the mix of all confusion, I lost a bit of who I was.
DepressDiaries|"Do you ever feel like...
If you were prettier...
Life would be easier?"
DepressDiaries|Why has the world turned on me and why have I turned on myself?
DepressDiaries|The reflection of my sorrows lies within my soul.
DepressDiaries|@notgonnadieana5 I understand. And I really do appreciate it. Because in certain situations you're right. And I always respect honesty.
DepressDiaries|@notgonnadieana5 Yes, if I had a main group of friends. But I dont. I don't care what strangers think, its not like I'll ever see them again
DepressDiaries|I'm not an idiot, they were all very well thought out.
DepressDiaries|And for everyone who thinks I'm a tatted loser, only 1 of my 6 tattoos is visible unless I'm in bikini or naked.
DepressDiaries|And I already have tattoo number 7 planned. 😉
DepressDiaries|They are as much a part of me as the blood that runs through my veins. Do I regret having both my rib cages tattooed? Nope. I never will.
DepressDiaries|I don't care if people judge them because they are a part of me. They represent the struggles I've gone through and continue to go through.
DepressDiaries|But I'm also very much my own person. I have 6 tattoos, 9 piercings and I absolutely love them all.
DepressDiaries|I'm a people pleaser, no question. I hate confrontation and will do anything to avoid it. I want everyone around me to be happy.
DepressDiaries|@notgonnadieana5 Huh? How would I be making my own hell?
DepressDiaries|"“@notgonnadieana5: @DepressDiaries Oh, it's up to you. I just personally wouldn't. I like people talking about me in good ways.”

Burn!! lol"
DepressDiaries|And as an added bonus I could pretend I was in Pretty Women
DepressDiaries|I think you all are right, it depends what they're worn with.
DepressDiaries|@notgonnadieana5 Because I already have a pair of those....in 2 different colors lol
DepressDiaries|@notgonnadieana5 Mine too but I want them 🙈
DepressDiaries|Are thigh high boots really slutty? #replytweet
DepressDiaries|Deal with people in a way that protects or enhances their self esteem.
DepressDiaries|And as she slowly covered up her scars, she realized what she had done. Made her life even worse.
DepressDiaries|What does the hero do when its himself he needs to save the world from?
DepressDiaries|I will wait for the person who can see through the lies and accept me for who I am.
DepressDiaries|My mind has a weird way of storing and throwing away memories, it saves the painful ones and throws out the happy ones.
DepressDiaries|She has no reason to cry yet she looks in the mirror and sees an ugly face which no one else sees.
DepressDiaries|"If a tree falls and no ones around does it still make a sound?
If a girl screams and no ones around does she still exist?"
DepressDiaries|"I haven't smiled today,
or yesterday
or last week
or last month
or maybe I can't remember...."
DepressDiaries|Every time I get my head above water it seems someone pushes me back down again.
DepressDiaries|It seems that every minute left for me is a waste of time to you.
DepressDiaries|Not to mention, how much money does he make???
DepressDiaries|Rerun of Dr. Phil &amp; he puts anorexia in the same category as drug addicts. He's wrong. A mental illness is not the same as a drug addiction.
DepressDiaries|"Ever try and open a childproof cap and think to yourself ""Holy crap, babies must be ridiculously strong theses days!"" Yea, me neither."
DepressDiaries|But is it really possible to own to many pairs of shoes?
DepressDiaries|Happiness is always easy to fake for a split second.
DepressDiaries|"I take the pain away
With a razor or a knife
You say that I'm crazy
I say I'm saving my life"
DepressDiaries|At the end of the day, even after everything everyones done to me, the only person I really hate is myself.
DepressDiaries|@m00n_walk3r I think early on my mom taught me it can always get worse. Good luck sweetheart you'll figure it out, I promise. xoxo
DepressDiaries|@m00n_walk3r I'm sorry, sometimes my humor doesn't translate into text. And well frankly there are other times I should just keep it quiet.
DepressDiaries|@m00n_walk3r This will not make you feel better, but I promise there will be a shitter week than this in the future. :)
DepressDiaries|You're wrong. My weight does define my worth. If that's inconceivable to you I'm glad. If that's everyday to you, you're not alone.
DepressDiaries|"Daddies lil failure
Mommies big mistake
College boy's lil victim
But who am I for goodness sake?"
DepressDiaries|I would rather, have a million people hate me for who I am...then have a million people love me for who I am not.
DepressDiaries|My scars are memories of the war I fought against myself. And they remind me that I lost a few battles, but I won the war.
DepressDiaries|All I want is one day where I don't contemplate suicide.
DepressDiaries|I can't even explain what I'm feeling, I just love you to death. But I'm still so broken, I feel like I'm not whole enough for you.
DepressDiaries|My dreams show me a life I could of had....
DepressDiaries|How Much Rain Must I Walk Threw Before I Get To The Sunshine?
DepressDiaries|"Growing Up Means Letting Go
Letting Go Means Growing Up"
DepressDiaries|@Empress_Noelle ...but what about people like me who have very severe cases? I should just kill myself now, the odds aren't in my favor.
DepressDiaries|@Empress_Noelle I know! But then what about people who also suffer from depression as well? Of course BDD includes a degree of depression...
DepressDiaries|Guys if you ever need anything please just ask. Let someone help you so you don't have to carry the burden alone. 💜
DepressDiaries|I love you all. I know it's hard to believe when I go missing for a week bc I'm stuck in a soul sucking depression. But I really do care. 💜
DepressDiaries|When you can't look on the bright side, I'll be sitting next to you in the dark.
DepressDiaries|I had no idea the suicide rate for BDD was so high.
DepressDiaries|People who have BDD and an anorexia-type eating history were almost twice as likely as other people with BDD to actually attempt suicide.
DepressDiaries|A study shows out of 200 people with Body Dysmorphic Disorder and found that 78 percent had thought about suicide.
DepressDiaries|All 3 on my scales are dirty filthy liars!!
DepressDiaries|"I feel like I'm losing everything I've ever known.
This is what happens when secret emotions are shown."
DepressDiaries|I will forgive but I will not forget...I hope you know you lost my respect.
DepressDiaries|Take pride in your pain. For you are stronger than those who have none.
DepressDiaries|"Why couldnt I just say
What happened to me that bad, bad day
The truth I just couldn't tell
Which is why into the darkness I fell"
DepressDiaries|I've lost a sence of reality, I'm beginning to wonder if my memory is real or not.
DepressDiaries|I've lied so much to myself that I don't know what is real anymore.
DepressDiaries|"I believe my favorite part is when he said ""I can't tell you"" yet proceeded to still tell me."
DepressDiaries|Does he even think before he speaks?????
DepressDiaries|"Boyfriend: ""I'd be mad too if a girl was like 100 pounds with natural DDs."""
DepressDiaries|"Boyfriend: ""I want to show you these models with amazing boobs but I can't show you or tell you because I don't want to make you feel bad."""
DepressDiaries|@ESEL1120 We both completely ignored the comment as if it were never said lol
DepressDiaries|@LovinNickelback What?? Twitter must be drunk, it should go home.
DepressDiaries|I woke up with a cat sitting on my chest.
DepressDiaries|@LovinNickelback DM me when you have a chance!
DepressDiaries|@hamour_ba7rani That is very true. But I usually take my medication to give me a boost of energy &amp; sometimes it keeps me awake longer.
DepressDiaries|However, you should also take into consideration I'm fat and need a work out.
DepressDiaries|The other day my neurologist told me my bed should only be used for sleep &amp; sex. That wasn't at all awkward with my mom sitting next to me..
DepressDiaries|May need to take into consideration that I didn't sleep last night, but did during the day. And I want to go out tonight &amp; not be exhausted.
DepressDiaries|Should I keep laying in bed trying to sleep or get up and try to do something useful?? It's your call! #replytweet
DepressDiaries|People always say, Everything will be okay, but what proof do they have of that?
DepressDiaries|And she wanted everyone to know that it's not her heartbreak that killed her, it was the need to be happy that did.
DepressDiaries|Those who do not remember the past are condemed to repeat it.
DepressDiaries|Forgetting yesterday's thoughts, tripping over today's mistakes, and hiding from tomorrow's consequences.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes hiding from pain, will only hurt you more.
DepressDiaries|A dream never dies the dreamer does.
DepressDiaries|She made depression look so beautiful, because the blood that spilled from her wrists matched the tears in her eyes.
DepressDiaries|"It sure as hell is a feeling to me!!

DepressDiaries|@alicekalun I'm going to DM you
DepressDiaries|@alicekalun I'm willing to work extremely hard on fundraising to help those who cannot pay. But I need people's feedback first.
DepressDiaries|@alicekalun They offer a 7 day free trial, then after that there are different payment options.
DepressDiaries|Please check out BetterHelp &amp; give me your feedback. I'm seriously considering fundraising if it will help u. It's just a 7 day free trail!!
DepressDiaries|"BetterHelp 
Please Retweet!! http://t.co/P8ipgDnnvH"
DepressDiaries|The world would go on, nothing would change. No one would notice a boy died from his pain.
DepressDiaries|The hardest part of life is not knowing what is really going to happen in the end...
DepressDiaries|Why is it I can always solve other people's problems but not my own?
DepressDiaries|She has no reason to cry yet she looks in the mirror and sees an ugly face which no one else sees.
DepressDiaries|You can only lie to yourself for so long, until it comes true.
DepressDiaries|I am the luckiest girl in this world because I have no tears left to cry, nothing left to loose and no one left to leave me behind.
DepressDiaries|I have nothing to say, I have nothing to give, my only purpose in life is to find my reason to live.
DepressDiaries|The secret to a happy life is selective memory.
DepressDiaries|It's just an emotion or something. Not actual hunger.
DepressDiaries|I'M NOT HUNGRY!!!!!
DepressDiaries|@BrokenPurge No, I would feel lonely too.
DepressDiaries|I try to block out the old memories as much as I can but sometimes they creep through and I fall apart all over again.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes it hits me all of the sudden.
DepressDiaries|When people say they'll be there for you, they only mean that as you fall they will stand and stare.
DepressDiaries|At the end of the day, even after everything everyone has done to me, the only person I really hate is myself.
DepressDiaries|@kariben56 Don't ever leave me again!!!! 😘❤
DepressDiaries|@bitethecrave I miss you so, so much beautiful girl. I think about you all the time. I love you, never forget that. 💕💗💕💗
DepressDiaries|I am not invincible, I'm someone who can break.
DepressDiaries|Though the fall will kill me for a moment, I will fly.
DepressDiaries|"I hate when people say ""There are people who have it worse"" Has that ever really made somebody feel better??"
DepressDiaries|@AishaEsat85 I don't! lol
DepressDiaries|I was diagnosed with my first autoimmune disorder at 17. So dont think you're to young &amp; Look into family genetics, that's a factor as well.
DepressDiaries|Depression and eating disorders can be side effects of an autoimmune disease. Get yourself checked to make sure ur being properly treated.
DepressDiaries|When you look at me you see a strong woman, but when I look in the mirror I see a broken child.
DepressDiaries|"Kiss me. Kill me.
Break my heart."
DepressDiaries|"Touch me. Fuck me.
Tear me apart."
DepressDiaries|"Hurt me. Beat me.
Take my soul."
DepressDiaries|"Break me.Take me.
Lose control."
DepressDiaries|"You have the right to hate me
But you do not have the right to judge me"
DepressDiaries|I never have things to run to, only things to run from.
DepressDiaries|I despise liars. Probably because depression has made me such a good one.
DepressDiaries|The depression takes over, there's nothing you can do to stop it, all you can do is try to survive.
DepressDiaries|"She's got the eyes of innocence; the face of an angel.
A personality of a dreamer &amp; a smile that hides more pain than you can ever imagine."
DepressDiaries|I didn't give up... I gave in.
DepressDiaries|I honestly never feel good enough for you, something is always wrong with me.
DepressDiaries|It's hard to believe someone that says you're beautiful, when everyday you tell yourself you're not.
DepressDiaries|She wonders what life would belike if she didn't feel.
DepressDiaries|I don't want to be alone...but being alone is when I'm truly myself...
DepressDiaries|Her heart may beat, but that doesn't mean she's alive.
DepressDiaries|Being alone hurts more than you will ever know; don't tell me it will get better because I have suffered long enough to know that it won't.
DepressDiaries|Only the best go through the worst.
DepressDiaries|"Dear Boyfriend,
Thank you, I appreciate it. But please stop."
DepressDiaries|The more my bf tells me how attractive I am or my body is the worse I feel. It makes me feel fatter and uglier than if nothing is said.
DepressDiaries|I get a shit load of email for a person with no friends.
DepressDiaries|@kariben56 DM so I'll remember lol
DepressDiaries|So lonely
DepressDiaries|Maybe I am just a number on a scale. Maybe that is my point. All of the billions of people on this planet, who said they all had a purpose?
DepressDiaries|"But why doesn't this feel true???

""@Veera_01: ""@AnEndToSuicide: http://t.co/CyuJVsSeNp"" this needs endless rts”"
DepressDiaries|If you lie to me, you die to me.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I forget. Thank you for being there to remind me of exactly how worthless I am.
DepressDiaries|“@BestProAdvice: http://t.co/Q25uYMjhkB” hahaha This definitely does not work. Especially when it's -10 outside. #wrongjustwrong
DepressDiaries|The only way I'll live another day is if I hold back my feelings from the day before.
DepressDiaries|Keep on running, and never look back, for If you do, you might trip, and yourself will catch up with you.
DepressDiaries|I just wish some memories didn't last forever. I swear reliving the same moment time after time will destroy you.
DepressDiaries|The most beautiful people are the ones to wake up, to struggle through pain, rejection, loss, &amp; still smile.
DepressDiaries|@UnbreakableIzMe Ankles should be 1 size fits all.
DepressDiaries|"Ever try and put on a pair of jeans and the bottoms are really tight so you're like, Wow, I have fat ankles. 
Yea, me too."
DepressDiaries|I'll smile forever, if it stops the questions
DepressDiaries|Reality scares me.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes when we think we are keeping a secret, that secret is actually keeping us.
DepressDiaries|I didn't choose to feel this pain, so why is it here? And when is it going away?
DepressDiaries|I'm more aware that I'm going to die someday, and less aware I'm living now.
DepressDiaries|The cold outside doesn't really effect you when you're already frozen on the inside.
DepressDiaries|"Your life is like a rainbow,
You start from one side, and try to get to the other.
But every time you take one step it gets further away."
DepressDiaries|I can't stand looking in the mirror because all I see is a failure...
DepressDiaries|"Kill her
Go ahead
Make her dreams come true"
DepressDiaries|Being able to survive it, doesn't mean that it was ever okay.
DepressDiaries|I am nothing more than Fake Smiles and Beautiful Scars
DepressDiaries|Somewhere in the mix of all confusion, I lost a bit of who I was.
DepressDiaries|"So tell me what you see,
When you look in my eyes,
I know what you should see,
A lost soul in disguise."
DepressDiaries|I've lost the pain I used to feel the only problem is the numbness just wont fade...
DepressDiaries|"Hiding behind the makeup 
Hoping you wont see the mark
Prying to the heaven
That maybe life can just restart"
DepressDiaries|I tried to save myself, but there is nothing worth saving.
DepressDiaries|"Look between the lines...
Look behind the smiles..."
DepressDiaries|Take pride in your pain. For you are stronger than those who have none.
DepressDiaries|They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but they never say a word is worth a thousand tears.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes, the one thing that has kept you happy, will be the one thing that will destroy everything.
DepressDiaries|There is nothing more addictive than a wound self-inflicted
DepressDiaries|"I hate my insecurity 
I hate how I choose to be
I hate the pointless tears I cry
But most of all, I hate being me"
DepressDiaries|I'm never safe, not even in my own skin.
DepressDiaries|I like it when it rains. It reminds me that even angels cry.
DepressDiaries|"Promises made, and promises broken,
These wounds that were healed, now are open."
DepressDiaries|I wish I was as invisible as you make me feel.
DepressDiaries|One day you'll care, but by then it will already be to late.
DepressDiaries|The cut may heal, but the hurt will last forever.
DepressDiaries|"She's got the bluest eyes
To hide all those delicate lies"
DepressDiaries|"And it looks like its raining
But the drops that fall are red
And you don't know why"
DepressDiaries|So beautify numb
DepressDiaries|I try so hard to please, but it's a waste of time. I'm just the disappointment in your life you can't get rid of.
DepressDiaries|I'm tired of being broken by the people who say they can fix me.
DepressDiaries|"It's kind of like it's something living inside you. 
Something you can't get rid of because
Killing it means killing you."
DepressDiaries|"Four words make up one of the biggest lies in history, ""I'm here to help."""
DepressDiaries|"Don't be fooled by my facade,
I've worn it now for years.
Often just below my smile,
My throat is full of tears."
DepressDiaries|She feels sad inside, but doesn't know where the pain came from, or how to start to make it go away.
DepressDiaries|I know my life could be so much worse but that does't mean what I'm going through doesn't hurt like hell.
DepressDiaries|My boyfriend inadvertently ruined his own Birthday sex. 😂😂😂 Poor bastard 😂
DepressDiaries|@Lorna_Simpson99 Damn...you're really lucky then :)
DepressDiaries|The best part of relationships is when you reach that point where you don't have to shave your legs every time you see him.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes, its easier to let the sky cry for you.
DepressDiaries|"She's got the eyes of innocence; the face of an angel.
A personality of a dreamer &amp; a smile that hides more pain than you can ever imagine."
DepressDiaries|She says I'm sick...that she never thought she'd have a kid like me. And I sit here and watch her move away like I'm a disease.
DepressDiaries|Dear People (especially the rude airport lady who gave me a dirty look), A person can be legally disabled w/o showing any physical symptoms!
DepressDiaries|The taste of regret is so strong.
DepressDiaries|"Have you ever laid in bed and just cried?
You think your ugly or you're not good enough.
You start counting all your flaws, from head to toe"
DepressDiaries|I honestly never feel good enough for you, something is always wrong with me.
DepressDiaries|It's hard to believe someone that says you're beautiful, when everyday you tell yourself you're not. 🙏
DepressDiaries|It's easy to tell me not to kill myself, it's hard to care when I decide to stick around.
DepressDiaries|Depression feels like home...and happiness is just a place you visit...
DepressDiaries|"Death is love, 
Beauty is hate. 
Perfection is blind, 
Pain is fate."
DepressDiaries|My inner pain is expressed by how much I smile; the greater the pain, the more I smile.
DepressDiaries|"Love her angel of despair,
Broken eyes to match her heart,
Shouting not to those who hear,
But those who too are torn apart."
DepressDiaries|Isn't it a shame when you're supposed to be alive, but you don't see the point in even living?
DepressDiaries|"I'm not the same.
I look the same.
Sound the same.
But, my smile's not as real as it used to be."
DepressDiaries|If you know how I feel then I feel sorry for you.
DepressDiaries|Being alone hurts more than you will ever know, don't tell me it will get better because I have suffered long enough to know that it won't.
DepressDiaries|If you could read in between the lines then you would see I never hated you, but that I hated me.
DepressDiaries|"The worst fealing is not death,
It is knowing that you are not needed,
That you are alone in this world,
That you have no reason to live..."
DepressDiaries|It's February, is it really necessary to be selling bathing suits already?
DepressDiaries|@BraveOllg Thank you very much! That really helped my day xoxo
DepressDiaries|Watching Dirty Dancing. Jennifer Grey....the only actress where a nose job ruined their career.

DepressDiaries|I'm used to being lonely...it's the only thing I can rely on these days.
DepressDiaries|I love the dark nobody can see you, nobody can judge you.
DepressDiaries|The rain helps me save my live from the pianful memories.
DepressDiaries|You wouldn't listen even if I told you.
DepressDiaries|Oh sorry I was looking for someone that cared.
DepressDiaries|Karma catches up no matter who you are.
DepressDiaries|"Laughter isn't always the best medicine.
Sometimes it's just a very clever disguise,
To hide the pain you feel deep inside."
DepressDiaries|"Used And Abused For Many Years..
Each Time A New Scar On My Heart..
I Hide Myself In My Own Dreams..
So, I Can't Be Torn Apart.."
DepressDiaries|Her Own Thoughts Turned Against Her
DepressDiaries|"I lock away the pain put away the fears
Show you only smiles not the hidden tears"
DepressDiaries|I am broken. I'm not afraid to say it.

DepressDiaries|February's challenge will be announced soon!!! Make sure you check @ED_Challenges!!!!
DepressDiaries|YAY!!!! @delicatefailure, @Prettyinthin and I are back together doing challenges!!!! 😊😊😊
DepressDiaries|How can you hide from what never goes away?
DepressDiaries|I can see that smile falling. Let it fall honey. You don't have to be strong for me.
DepressDiaries|"And every time she tries to give up; Hope whispers ""One More Try"""
DepressDiaries|"I feel isolated from everyone and I’m out of control,
I need someone like me just so I’m not on my own."
DepressDiaries|"She's in a suicidal mindset
Popping pills to chase the dreams 
And sipping booze to ease the screams"
DepressDiaries|Sometimes it hurts more not to break the skin.
DepressDiaries|Living is easy when eyes are closed. Misunderstanding is all you see.
DepressDiaries|"And she whispers into the mirror,
As she wipes the tears,
From her blood-shot eyes,
""What did I do to deserve this??"""
DepressDiaries|What happens when...You don't even know how you feel anymore?
DepressDiaries|@skinnyanorexic Miss you, Love you 💕💗
DepressDiaries|...I don't love you...I love who I thought you were...
DepressDiaries|"It's a cold world, 
Full of cold places. 
Full of cold people, 
Wearing two faces."
DepressDiaries|It's hard to keep my head up when it's been down for so long.
DepressDiaries|"And she's the kind of girl that
Doesn't say much...but when
She does - it means alot."
DepressDiaries|I hate depression. Such a terrible illness. But I'll tell ya, more often than not insomnia makes me want to shoot myself in the face more.
DepressDiaries|The wounds you've inflicted on me go deep into my soul and I know they'll never heal...
DepressDiaries|Memories can be painful, to forget may be a blessing.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes when she thinks no one is watching, she closes her eyes and prays to God for help to get through the day.
DepressDiaries|There are times when its impossible to smile. That sad feeling just washes over you. And there is nothing you can do about it.
DepressDiaries|In a world where death surrounds us, all I care about is living, but I still can't help feeling dead inside.
DepressDiaries|To be forgotten is worse than death.
DepressDiaries|Depression is more than just a word... It takes everything away, everything you ever hoped for in life...everything...
DepressDiaries|"Wear me like a locket around your throat,
I'll weigh you down and watch you choke."
DepressDiaries|Words evaporate on my tongue. I scream but it goes unnoticed. The screaming is in my mind.
DepressDiaries|If every cut rids the mental pain, what stops the physical?
DepressDiaries|Its not that I want to die....Its just that I am so sick of living.
DepressDiaries|"My fault, my sin.
I quit, you win."
DepressDiaries|"We have to first know sadness before we can know what true happiness is.
So let that first tear be shed."
DepressDiaries|"Love is hidden within pain, 
So we have to hurt to feel,
To fall before someone will catch us."
DepressDiaries|Tell me...is it wrong that the only time I feel truly loved is when I'm being used?
DepressDiaries|It hurts more to smile than it does to cry.
DepressDiaries|Damaged people are dangerous people because they know they can survive.
DepressDiaries|"I need you to protect me from my demons. 
I need you to save me from my mistakes.
I dont want to die, I need you to save me."
DepressDiaries|The truth is everyone is going to hurt you, you just have to decide who is worth the pain.
DepressDiaries|I hide my scars because you don't have the right to know the trick to life.
DepressDiaries|Why did I cut, you ask. Because it feels so damn good to feel alive.
DepressDiaries|I need someone to save me from all that I am.
DepressDiaries|I don't know...part of me thinks it's time to leave you in my past...
DepressDiaries|I think its funny how people believe their cruel words towards me are so powerful. Pls Bitch, I'll tell myself worse just cause its Tuesday.
DepressDiaries|There's just so much that time can't erase.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I think my past is all I got.
DepressDiaries|How could you believe in me when you never gave me a chance to prove this all wrong?
DepressDiaries|In this world of color I feel so grey.
DepressDiaries|If you could read inbetween the line then you would see I never hated you, but that I hated me.
DepressDiaries|All I do is exist.
DepressDiaries|Love Is A Small Word That Shouldn't Be Said As Often As We Say It
DepressDiaries|People can only destroy you if you let them.
DepressDiaries|To be left behind...or to leave behind I wonder what hurts the most...
DepressDiaries|It's bad when cutting your wrist is the only option...
DepressDiaries|He left her sad and incomplete; yet he is the only thing that can end her tears, and make her whole again.
DepressDiaries|Lies Written In Ink Cannot Disguise Facts Written In Blood
DepressDiaries|"Squirming and screaming
Taking none of it in
Too sad to give a shit
Depression wins."
DepressDiaries|"Thoughts colliding
Trying to escape 
Brain twisting
Her life's at stake..."
DepressDiaries|"I'm used to being lonely..
It's the only thing I
Can rely on these days"
DepressDiaries|@roleplaybieber I completely understand! Your recovery is 100% so much more important!

DepressDiaries|Does anyone know a brand of bedtime tea that actually works?? Please! Thank you #replytweet
DepressDiaries|You cant change yourself; just hide behind a beautiful mask painted with silver lies that you create evertime you turn away from truth.
DepressDiaries|I Rather Be Invisible, Then To Allow You To See A Failure In Me
DepressDiaries|Do you see the pain within my eyes? Or can you only hear my I'm okay lies?
DepressDiaries|Karma catches up no matter who you are...
DepressDiaries|...Now all I can do is look at what I don't have, and wish I were dead.
DepressDiaries|I remember when I was a child, and was always afraid of dieing and losing what I had...
DepressDiaries|I make a lot of mistakes but you were definitely the best one.
DepressDiaries|The darkness devours you...and the sun burns through your skin.
DepressDiaries|I am afraid of what I've never felt...
DepressDiaries|"She would change everything... Everything... Just ask her...
Caught in the in-between of a beautiful disaster..."
DepressDiaries|How can you hide from what never goes away?
DepressDiaries|Every now and then I get tired of listening to the sound of my own tears.
DepressDiaries|"There are no tears left in these eyes,
No smile left in these lips,
And I no longer know how I can keep going on with life the way it is."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes, you've got to get fucked up to feel sober, cry to see clear &amp; fall a hundred times to learn how to pick yourself back up again.
DepressDiaries|"She's breaking down &amp; everyone's fading.
It's been too long &amp; she's tired of waiting."
DepressDiaries|You are my nameless scar inside.
DepressDiaries|I'm fading away, soon I'll be just a feeling, I'll be the cold breeze you feel, as you walk home late at night.
DepressDiaries|They say be open with your feelings. Minute you do, notice how everyone runs, because its too much for them to handle?
DepressDiaries|"The blade touches my skin with the care of a lover...
And I fall into pain's embrace..."
DepressDiaries|With my loneliness, I'm never alone.
DepressDiaries|With cuts on her wrists and tears running down her face, she wonders if she is beautiful now.
DepressDiaries|She's scared to show the real her, because what if the real her isn't enough?
DepressDiaries|I can see that smile falling. Let it fall honey. You don't have to be strong for me.
DepressDiaries|Cheer up beautiful; The worst is still to come...
DepressDiaries|"They say all she is a mistake,
And all she does is want to fight.
But no one hears her screams,
Or sees the way she cries at night."
DepressDiaries|I'll try to show him a smile even if it hurts...
DepressDiaries|She just looks so innocent..that doesnt mean she is...
DepressDiaries|No one can hurt me now, I'll hurt myself before they get a chance...
DepressDiaries|"We built it up to watch it fall,
It's like we never had anything at all."
DepressDiaries|"I feel isolated from everyone and I’m out of control.
I need someone like me just so I’m not on my own."
DepressDiaries|You don't owe anyone an explanation http://t.co/DSpE1Fg3RL
DepressDiaries|When the world came crashing down it landed right on the shoulders of a girl who tried to never frown.
DepressDiaries|"The future lies before you,
Like the paths of pure white snow. 
Be careful how you treat it,
For every step will show."
DepressDiaries|When will there be a smile on my face that isn't a lie?
DepressDiaries|Starting to believe the only one I trust is lying to me.
DepressDiaries|"I quit this childish game,
I'll even take the blame.
But I won't cry anymore,
I'm walking out the door."
DepressDiaries|With false hope everything is broken.
DepressDiaries|You may hate me, but at least I don't hide who I really am, how about you?
DepressDiaries|"Somedays I manage a smile
And somdays I even laugh
But this is short lived
Because of my terrible past"
DepressDiaries|Every tear that rolls down my cheek I wipe off so you can't see...I muffle the sound of my shattering heart so you can't hear me scream.
DepressDiaries|"Hopeless and lonely
Running from life, death, and love
With no one to care."
DepressDiaries|"You would be surprised
By what you see in my eyes
All the pain and the sorrow
Of yesterday, today and tomorrow."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes you got to realize, dreams get destroyed, hearts get ripped apart, and tears fall...
DepressDiaries|Seems counter productive. Oh well.
DepressDiaries|Am I the only person who reads self help books while thinking to myself, okay but I don't want to change that thing, or that thing.
DepressDiaries|I've been broken so many times the pieces are too small to put back together.
DepressDiaries|"Why do you think I'm worthless?
And why do I agree?
I am nothing to you
Because I am nothing to me."
DepressDiaries|"Lace your lips with cyanide
And kiss me quick before it's dried"
DepressDiaries|I always thought he'd love me for who I was, but instead he hated me for who I wasn't.
DepressDiaries|"As I look into the mirror to wipe away all the running mascara I whisper ""How can I be this Stupid?!?!"""
DepressDiaries|Try not to take things personally, what people say about you is a reflection of them, not you.
DepressDiaries|I bitch and complain but I would take all the pain in my life times 10,000 if I knew my sister would finally be able to find her happiness.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes you have to live with what's dealt to you, even if it breaks your heart.
DepressDiaries|I can fight back the tears, and wear a fake smile, but nothing's gonna make, my life worth the while..
DepressDiaries|Nobody ever stays.
DepressDiaries|Will give anything for the artificial happiness which momentarily makes her forget the pain she feels.
DepressDiaries|--- And if you're going to insult me, at one point in time I must have mattered. Either that or maybe, just maybe, I still do.
DepressDiaries|I hold dearly onto your insults because I know, to insult me you have to think about me. ---
DepressDiaries|It seems the times I want to cry, are the times I need to make everyone think I'm strong.
DepressDiaries|It's not that I'm suicidal, I just embrace death with open arms.
DepressDiaries|I want to run away...not from my problems, but from myself...but I know deep down inside...that I'll be running forever...
DepressDiaries|Is your happiness worth my sanity?
DepressDiaries|"Oblivion is my home,
Where no one comes to stay.
My heart slowly turned to stone,
And my soul has faded away."
DepressDiaries|Just when you thought you've lost everything, you find out that you can lose a little more.
DepressDiaries|Tears are a language only the lost can understand.
DepressDiaries|You dont know what its like, to be on the outside lookin in, feeling like there's something wrong, like you can never win.
DepressDiaries|It's funny how I'm surrounded by so many people and yet this is the loneliest I've felt in my entire life.
DepressDiaries|Remember me for who I am, not who you wanted me to be.
DepressDiaries|"Maybe it's too late for me. 
Maybe there's no going back. 
Maybe I can't be saved. 
Maybe it's all going black."
DepressDiaries|"Call me what you want
Laugh, point, or stare
Whatever makes you feel better;
Whatever makes your pathetic life easier to bare"
DepressDiaries|The worst part is having to bite your lip and pretending that it didn't bother you.
DepressDiaries|"Do you know how it feels to be lost and confused? 
To look around and notice you're alone in this world?"
DepressDiaries|"Tell me I will be okay
I won't believe you
But I'll pretend to"
DepressDiaries|"She doesn't want tomorrow to come.
She's afraid that it will be the same as today...
She's afraid that it won't be a better day"
DepressDiaries|"It's not that I wanted to be different...
It's just that I wanted to be me"
DepressDiaries|The dream doesn't die, the dreamer does.
DepressDiaries|"""I'm sorry"" doesn't fix things. ""I love you"" doesn't fix things. Words cannot fix things because actions speak louder than words."
DepressDiaries|I look back over my life &amp; remember all the happy times, the fun times, me and my family. Then I realize I'm not remembering, I'm imagining.
DepressDiaries|When most of what you hear are lies how will you know the truth?
DepressDiaries|I want my life back, just not the pain it comes with.
DepressDiaries|She no longer needs someone to push her down, and make her feel like shit. She's doing it herself.
DepressDiaries|I'm sorry, I can't be who you want me to be.
DepressDiaries|Get drunk on my tears and drown in my blood, this isn't crazy it's just my love...
DepressDiaries|"Flashbacks
Streaks of pain
A river of tears 
I've taken an overdose of my mind"
DepressDiaries|Fear is temporary whereas regret is forever...
DepressDiaries|"Release my pain.
Release my sorrows.
Let me bleed.
For no more tomorrows."
DepressDiaries|"She walks on.
She cries.
She falls down.
She tries.
She gets up again.
She walks on."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I won't be the quickest to respond, but I always will. Promise 💖 http://t.co/TZo9hIJoPd

DepressDiaries|I'm just a kid http://t.co/lTw4hGWryZ
DepressDiaries|Nvm, I fucked it up.
DepressDiaries|@Sufferes I'm sure she didn't mean anything. If you read the back of the case they dont mention mental problems, she prob doesn't even know.
DepressDiaries|"""One incident can change a lifetime."" --I really hope this guy's shrink isn't expensive with those types of cliches he's handing out."
DepressDiaries|Omg, I do go off on tangents about books like he just did with Hemingway 😂
DepressDiaries|@cookiechipzouis Maybe there's a crazy guy out there for me then lol
DepressDiaries|Is this like a sad movie I shouldn't try and watch while working out?
DepressDiaries|Maybe she's trying to say, Hey kid, you might not end up living with me forever after all!!!
DepressDiaries|Mom got me Silver Lining Playbook for Xmas should I be offended bc he was in a mental hospital or happy bc he finds a girl as crazy as he is
DepressDiaries|All I needed, was to be wanted, was that too much to ask?
DepressDiaries|Thankful for the darkness that numbed the pain in my heart and soul...
DepressDiaries|There is only so much pain my words can express... so I let my scars do the talking...
DepressDiaries|I may be different, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong...
DepressDiaries|I won't do anything else wrong, but I can't fix who I am.
DepressDiaries|Life is filled with nothing but broken hearts and shattered dreams.
DepressDiaries|"Pity is pratically the same thing as saying ""you're pathetic."""
DepressDiaries|To be alone in life is her biggest fear.
DepressDiaries|The softest noise you'll ever hear is someone letting you go.
DepressDiaries|"If I yelled your name would you hear my call?
If I cried for you would you care at all?"
DepressDiaries|The cruelest lies are often told in silence.
DepressDiaries|I miss having the feeling that someone cared.
DepressDiaries|"Pop another pill, 
Smoke some more
Have a drink 
And cut deeper than ever before"
DepressDiaries|Death is not the most tragic loss in life. The most tragic loss is what dies inside while you're still alive.
DepressDiaries|Let me sit here and pretend I'm actually worth something to you.
DepressDiaries|Somedays I prefer the little girl I was to the woman I'm becoming.
DepressDiaries|Darkness can enslave your very soul, no matter how pure you may be.
DepressDiaries|Why are lies always told but truth kept secrect?
DepressDiaries|@bitethecrave I always forget how pretty you are. xoxo
DepressDiaries|"The closer I look 
The more I see
How we were never meant to be"
DepressDiaries|But then I realized I had no words to describe the hopelessness in my gut.
DepressDiaries|I'm sorry that you hate the thing that makes me unique...
DepressDiaries|I already have enough weight on my shoulders, I don't need you on me too.
DepressDiaries|I want to act like nothing's wrong, breathe like its okay and be the happiest person I can be.
DepressDiaries|"Away from this I run,
From this world, this life, tired
And unsure of where I go from here,
I close my eye's and hope I sleep forever."
DepressDiaries|I can't look in your eyes, for you remind me of everything I lost.
DepressDiaries|"In the mirror she thought, ""What's wrong with me now?"" Then she thought ""What is NOT wrong with me?"""
DepressDiaries|Friends is on Netflix now, so you just basically need to watch the whole series beginning to end. No breaks.
DepressDiaries|Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather live one of their lives. But it's nice when they suck.
DepressDiaries|They really told me this part of my life would suck.
DepressDiaries|"Someone to face the day with
Make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst I'm best with you"
DepressDiaries|"No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me"
DepressDiaries|Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
DepressDiaries|"You're still in bed at ten
And work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast
So far... things are goin' great"
DepressDiaries|"It's like you're always stuck in second gear
And it hasn't been your day, your week, your month,
or even your year"
DepressDiaries|"So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your jobs a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A."
DepressDiaries|The theme song to Friends is really the only thing that didn't lie to me when I was growing up.
DepressDiaries|Why am I always holding on to something that isn't even there anymore?
DepressDiaries|“@NewEngland_Girl: I'm about 2 Facebook engagements away from unfriending everyone on my newsfeed that's in a relationship.” 🙏
DepressDiaries|Thanks guys!! 💗
DepressDiaries|@LeBlancDeNoir Really?? Everything I have read about them mentions how they're not UV rays so you won't get cancer
DepressDiaries|@IxneIiness It says to ask your doctor but my doctor is an idiot and won't have any idea
DepressDiaries|@IxneIiness This one doesn't because it's made for normal people.
DepressDiaries|@bravelyblog Thank you!!
DepressDiaries|@IxneIiness Yea my sis got me one for Christmas but I think the wattage is to low bc it was also recommended for regular people
DepressDiaries|Does anyone know what the best light for Seasonal Affective Disorder or Depression is?? Please, please help me!!!
DepressDiaries|My confidence is just as fake as my smile.
DepressDiaries|The Scars Remind Me That The Past Is Real
DepressDiaries|It just doesnt matter, I simply don't care anymore.
DepressDiaries|Forever is a funny thing - it's always shorter than it seems.
DepressDiaries|"Death stumps her,
Rape continues to rattle her,
Visions conquer her,
Blades cut her,
Numbness takes over her."
DepressDiaries|What's the point in continuing on when you don't even have the strength to stand?
DepressDiaries|I just want to be loved. Will someone save me from this hell hole?
DepressDiaries|People yell and scream at me, I try to tune them out but that just makes it worse.
DepressDiaries|My soul flows sadly through these gashes in my wrist.
DepressDiaries|"Someone Old, 
No One New, 
Feeling Borrowed, 
Always Blue"
DepressDiaries|I'm old enough to know better....too young to care.
DepressDiaries|I could drown in a ocean of things I'll never say.
DepressDiaries|Please someone take away my pain....make me smile....make me forget how hurt I am....
DepressDiaries|"Looking in the mirror 
With scornful eyes
She curses every imperfection
No mark or blemish
Goes unnoticed
For her fear of rejection"
DepressDiaries|I feel like nothing can save me, it's something I just can't undo.
DepressDiaries|There's just so much that time can't erase.
DepressDiaries|I feel heartbroken, but also like there's a hole in my heart. I just don't understand how there can be a hold in something so broken.
DepressDiaries|To the broken and lost and hurt, if you feel like it is you against the world, just know I'm on your side.
DepressDiaries|The truth is I'm lost, and I don't know where to go.
DepressDiaries|It's kind of funny because no one really knows the real me. But it's sad, because by no one, I was including myself.
DepressDiaries|"I want to tell you all of my secrets,
But you walk away when I try.
I want to tell you what is wrong,
But you're never there when I cry."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes the person you want most is the person you're best without.
DepressDiaries|"Icy Heart
Cold to the Bone
Peircing Eyes
Lips Like Stone
She Looked Around
And Saw She Was Alone..."
DepressDiaries|Love Is A Small Word That Shouldn't Be Said As Often As We Say It
DepressDiaries|I hope you watch as I'm falling down, because you are the reason I am hitting the ground...
DepressDiaries|"I love the dark.
Nobody can see you,
Nobody can judge you."
DepressDiaries|There is no greater agony than bearing an unwritten story inside of you.
DepressDiaries|Her own thoughts turned against her.
DepressDiaries|"Man, it takes a silly girl 
To lie about the dreams she has.
But Lord, it takes a lonely girl to wish
That she had never dreamt at all."
DepressDiaries|Every now and then I get tired of listening to the sound of my own tears.
DepressDiaries|What do you do when everyone is begging you to keep going but every ounce of you is screaming to give up?
DepressDiaries|There are no tears left in these eyes, no smile left in these lips and I no longer know how I can keep going on with life the way it is.
DepressDiaries|"She's breaking down and everyone's fading.
It's been too long and she's tired of waiting."
DepressDiaries|Maybe if my heart stops beating it won't hurt this much.
DepressDiaries|And even though she acts like nothing is wrong when you ask, maybe, just maybe she's really good at lying.
DepressDiaries|And just because she comes off strong doesn't mean she didn't fall asleep crying.
DepressDiaries|With all the things running though my head.. the only thing I can focus on is how I wish I were dead.
DepressDiaries|I'm the reason my sister is heart broken and alone. I'll never forgive myself.
DepressDiaries|Ever since you left I put up this gaurd. And no one else is ever going to get as close to me as you did.
DepressDiaries|Do you understand what you have done to me? Behind that closed door is me with that razor blade carving the pain away.
DepressDiaries|Just when I start picking up the pieces, you just have to rip them out of my hands...
DepressDiaries|"Tell me I'm beautiful.
I need you to lie to me today."
DepressDiaries|"This razor.
These scissors.
This knife
These sharp objects.
They are all my friends.
Don't take them away from me."
DepressDiaries|"She keeps asking me, ""Do you think it hurts when you die?"" I thought to myself, ""It hurts more to live..."""
DepressDiaries|You gave up on me first.
DepressDiaries|My confidence is just as fake as my smile.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I plaster on a smile, just so you don't focus on the bleeding.
DepressDiaries|"This alcohol will choke my tears, drown my angry heart.
I'll pretend I'm empty of fears, that I'm not falling apart."
DepressDiaries|"What has meant everything to me
Is just a part of the past
It all ceases to exist
But the memories always last"
DepressDiaries|"No matter how much you may want something...
No matter how much you wish and pray for it...
Sometimes it's just not meant to be..."
DepressDiaries|"Tell me I will be okay.
I won't believe you,
But I'll pretend to..."
DepressDiaries|And you will just never know what hides behind my smile.
DepressDiaries|Why do their well chosen words hurt me more than the cuts and bruises I inflict upon myself?
DepressDiaries|"I'm afraid to be alone
Not because I won't know what to do,
But because I know what I will do."
DepressDiaries|"She doesn't want tomorrow to come.
She's afraid that it will be the same as today...
She's afraid that it won't be a better day"
DepressDiaries|You're everything that I'm not...but I wish I could be.
DepressDiaries|"And that girl in the mirror isn't me.
Her eyes are so sad and her smile so broken.
I didn't know it had gotten that bad."
DepressDiaries|"Don't be mad at me for being this way. It wasn`t my choice to be sad.
I would do anything to be happy again."
DepressDiaries|"It's not that I wanted to be different...
It's just that I wanted to be me..."
DepressDiaries|And I think the thing that hurts the most, is you don't even know I'm in pain.
DepressDiaries|I have a bad habit, and the habit is you.
DepressDiaries|The dream doesn't die the dreamer does.
DepressDiaries|"Tired of trying
With no success
Tired of crying
And being loveless"
DepressDiaries|"""I'm sorry"" doesnt fix things. ""I love you"" doesn't fix things. Words cannot fix things because actions speak louder than words."
DepressDiaries|And just beacuse she breathes, it doesn't mean she's living.
DepressDiaries|"You know what hurts more than anything? 
Feeling like there is a chance, but knowing there really isn't."
DepressDiaries|I look back over my life &amp; remember all the happy times, the fun times, me &amp; my family. Then I realize, I'm not remembering, I'm imagining.
DepressDiaries|I'm not ready to die but I'm not yet ready to live either.
DepressDiaries|I'm not a person who has depression anymore...I've become depression who has a person...
DepressDiaries|@star_curl I guess we cancel each other then lol :)
DepressDiaries|Noo!! That can't be true. Can it??
DepressDiaries|"""The average person has 10.5 sexual partners in their lifetime."""
DepressDiaries|I bet sleep in nice.
DepressDiaries|Somewhere we live inside
DepressDiaries|"We want more than this world's got to offer 
We want more than the wars of our fathers 
And everything inside screams for second life"
DepressDiaries|"We were meant to live for so much more 
Have we lost ourselves?"
DepressDiaries|When most of what you hear are lies how will you know the truth?
DepressDiaries|Bruises fade but the pain remains the same
DepressDiaries|"No one knows she's a lost soul,
Searching for a way out.
Only you can save her,
But you never took the time to notice her."
DepressDiaries|I want my life back, just not the pain it comes with.
DepressDiaries|"Sooner or later, 
We all give up, dont we?"
DepressDiaries|"She isn't where she is supposed to be,
And the sad part is,
She knows it."
DepressDiaries|"She knows no matter how hard she tries,
You'll never love her."
DepressDiaries|She no longer needs someone to push her down, and make her feel like shit. She's doing it herself.
DepressDiaries|"It's easier to pretend to be strong,
Then tell everything why you no longer,
Can make it through one night,
Without crying yourself to sleep"
DepressDiaries|@skxnnylies I missed when all the bridesmaids picked out their dresses. It was on a week night, some people have things to do.
DepressDiaries|@Prettyinthin I'm with ya baby. I'm gonna keep going until I can't anymore.
DepressDiaries|@Prettyinthin Lucky
DepressDiaries|I got kicked out of being a bridesmaid in my really good friends wedding because of my depression. I'm not even surprised anymore.
DepressDiaries|@StayStrongMAG Go crazy sweetheart! I love you, if you ever need anything just let me know, I'll be there for you! ❤😘
DepressDiaries|You are too young #truth http://t.co/9WTszgoHR8
DepressDiaries|Yeah, I get these feelings too http://t.co/iewBJoUEeY
DepressDiaries|Reminder http://t.co/x5fsSE8s8G
DepressDiaries|Better to do it myself http://t.co/tTxhhjyJxT
DepressDiaries|You lost... http://t.co/6gqbSCPgu8
DepressDiaries|We all do... http://t.co/zUIooZaPsk
DepressDiaries|We all win and we all lose http://t.co/LOAhyZK1rH
DepressDiaries|Just get over it they say... http://t.co/aJONVWVW0q
DepressDiaries|Today, I finally realized... http://t.co/88XeQidni4
DepressDiaries|I am a Fuck Up #truth http://t.co/Pm3VdRSD34
DepressDiaries|There is no point...it's just like cancer http://t.co/4GiQrw1o3P
DepressDiaries|Let Me Out http://t.co/KHFc1RFc8a
DepressDiaries|Fake it 'til you make it http://t.co/eScfvNtPlq
DepressDiaries|It's impossible to ever see the end http://t.co/Kli590pxwW
DepressDiaries|"They can take the future that we'll never know,
But I'll never let them have the memories of yesterday."
DepressDiaries|Just close your eyes and pretend I'm the smart, pretty girl you really want.
DepressDiaries|"Flashbacks
Streaks of pain
A river of tears 
I've taken an overdose of my mind"
DepressDiaries|I don't really live in a home, it's only a house. If you don't know the difference between a house and a home.......you're lucky
DepressDiaries|"Release my pain.
Release my sorrows.
Let me bleed.
For no more tomorrows."
DepressDiaries|"Starlight, 
Starbright, 
First star I see tonight,
I wish I may,
I wish I might,
End this life I hate tonight,"
DepressDiaries|All I needed, was to be wanted, was that too much to ask?
DepressDiaries|The scales continue to tell the story of your failure.
DepressDiaries|And as the white rabbit of my lost innocence places my crown of thorns upon my head I am now queen of the dirt I rot in.
DepressDiaries|"So I cut and I scream and I bleed, 
But still no chance of being freed."
DepressDiaries|"I just want to scream, 
Wake up out of this dream."
DepressDiaries|"I am angry and confused, and I dont know why.
I am upset and I just want to cry."
DepressDiaries|"Those who do not understand the dark fear it,
Those who embrace the dark fear nothing."
DepressDiaries|One day she will fall, to far for anyone to reach her, one day you will realize she isn't coming home anymore...
DepressDiaries|Life is filled with nothing but broken hearts and shattered dreams.
DepressDiaries|"Blood drips
Tears fall
Smiles hide it all"
DepressDiaries|I made my own physically sick. I guess I really am the asshole.
DepressDiaries|It's a week before Christmas and you're trying to sell your kids old shoes via fb. You don't need the money. Donate them you stupid bitch!!
DepressDiaries|My soul seems to be a puzzle with only the wrong kind of pieces.
DepressDiaries|I hate you and it's your own fault, yet you manage to make me feel guilty.
DepressDiaries|I try my hardest to be strong...but sometimes weakness gets the best of me.
DepressDiaries|We are all too young to have to feel like this...
DepressDiaries|"They laugh,
While I cry.
They point,
As I die."
DepressDiaries|I don't blame you for the broken smile I constantly wear upon my face, I blame myself for trying too hard and caring too much.
DepressDiaries|Admitting you're hurt can be harder than being hurt.
DepressDiaries|"Honestly? 
No, I'm not okay. And I've never been ""just okay"". And I don't think I will ever be ""just okay""..."
DepressDiaries|I am broken down, tacked to the ground, way passed falling down, I feel a great storm coming, and the way I see it, I am going to drown.
DepressDiaries|The world keeps changing yet I stand still.
DepressDiaries|The world is beautiful.... without me
DepressDiaries|"I'm sorry that I only got in your way.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
I'm sorry I failed you.
I'm sorry that I couldn't help anymore."
DepressDiaries|No amount of cuts, skipped meals, or how many times I cried myself to sleep could ever explain to you how much pain I've been through.
DepressDiaries|All I do is ache, I can't find any peace of mind.
DepressDiaries|My life resembles a flame. Ever changing and always destroying.
DepressDiaries|Because messing up takes practice, and on that; I'm well rehearsed.
DepressDiaries|Time can heal only so much...
DepressDiaries|Cold, numb, stressed, tired, depressed... i'm tired of feeling so worthless.
DepressDiaries|"I'm out of control spiraling down,
I don't want help so I don't make a sound."
DepressDiaries|"I'm left all alone in this secretive world,
All of the thoughts in my mind are swirled."
DepressDiaries|She finds it ironic as she puts the blade to her wrist, that you dont even realize it isnt the knife tearing at her skin- but your own words
DepressDiaries|@IxneIiness Aww, thank you so much, you're so sweet! If you ever need anything just let me know, I'm always here. 💖
DepressDiaries|With this broken heart I scream...but in this blind &amp; deaf world no one hears the sound of my soul in pain...it was just a waste of breath.
DepressDiaries|"Lonely and forgotten.
Incomplete and sad.
Slowly losing sanity.
Slowly going mad."
DepressDiaries|Broken emotions hurt much less severely... than silent emotions.
DepressDiaries|"Teach me how to hate you 
Teach me how not to care 
Teach me you never wanted me
That you were never really there"
DepressDiaries|What would you do if the world gave up on you?
DepressDiaries|@notgonnadieana Guilty...I love that movie so much though! 😊
DepressDiaries|Loving your happiness in a bottle of alcohol more than you love your depressed daughter. #Daddy
DepressDiaries|Hell isn't where you live - Hell is what you caused.
DepressDiaries|Maybe there is a reason why I'm still alive. But I'm still searching for that reason.
DepressDiaries|She's crying and no one's replying.
DepressDiaries|Tears are a sign that you have given in. Don't show them because the person or thing you're cring for will have won the war.
DepressDiaries|"Where it all becomes so numb,
When there are tears spilling down your cheeks,
And you're not even crying anymore...
You're just breathing..."
DepressDiaries|I don't want to talk about it anymore because that means it's real... just let me believe it's not for one minute.
DepressDiaries|"I'm so unsure of myself,
I don't know how to handle this.
Is it so wrong to cry?
Is it so wrong to wish?"
DepressDiaries|I fight to live, I pray to die, I scream for pain, and bleed to cry
DepressDiaries|I dont fear life...fear those who are in it...
DepressDiaries|Love is rare, Life is strange, Nothing lasts... People change
DepressDiaries|In my search for the truth, I became a lie.
DepressDiaries|"Pump the drugs
Through my veins
Numb my body
Get rid of the pain"
DepressDiaries|Why do parents say don't care if someone judges you, if they judge you the most?
DepressDiaries|"Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know"
DepressDiaries|All I want for Christmas is to be thin.
DepressDiaries|The Little Mermaid is on ABC Family tonight at 6 #YoureWelcome
DepressDiaries|"I try to find myself
I find the stranger trapped inside
And I'll take one more step away
From the face I used to recognize"
DepressDiaries|I wish I were really as invisible as you make me seem.
DepressDiaries|I was about to fall when I remembered...I don't believe in love anymore.
DepressDiaries|She's sick of being the one to always make the effort.
DepressDiaries|We all live in fairytales, just some of us are the lonely girl that don't make it to the end.
DepressDiaries|I look in the mirror to find something beautiful but all I see is me.
DepressDiaries|Everytime I'm on the verge of renewing my hopes, you remind me why they faded before...
DepressDiaries|Everything you have you lose. No matter how hard you grab onto something, you still lose it.
DepressDiaries|I should be used to the pain by now.
DepressDiaries|This world is such a terrible and unfair place.
DepressDiaries|I can't keep pretending that everything's okay.
DepressDiaries|Nothing I do makes a difference anymore. So why do I bother trying?
DepressDiaries|Sometimes words aren't enough to express how depressed you truly are.
DepressDiaries|When you gave up on me, I gave up on me too.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes we're broken and we don't know why.
DepressDiaries|I can't forgive until I can fully heal. That's if I can heal at all...
DepressDiaries|"Fake a smile,
Don't tell the truth,
Fake a life,
Fake a you."
DepressDiaries|Hiding depression by hiding myself.
DepressDiaries|I am tired of not existing.
DepressDiaries|There's nothing more addictive than memories.
DepressDiaries|All I really want is for you to look at me, really look at me and see me, and love me for who I am. Dad, that's all I want.
DepressDiaries|"The worst feeling is not death,
It is knowing that u arent needed
That u are alone in this world,
And that u no longer have a reason to live"
DepressDiaries|No one understands what it is like to get lost in the fire, lost in our own soul.
DepressDiaries|Someone please just help me get through this nightmare.
DepressDiaries|Why get rid of the pain if it's just going to come back?
DepressDiaries|"Pain is a figment of your imagination
Block it out when u want to feel numb
Or let it in when you want to feel alive
Pain is your own choice"
DepressDiaries|I am my own poison.
DepressDiaries|"Dying To Be Beautiful..
Starving For Your Attention..
Bleeding To Release This Hurt..
Is This What Life's Really About?"
DepressDiaries|And just when you think life can't get any worse, everything gets better and its okay to smile...until the dark cloud comes again.
DepressDiaries|I only drink late because I miss you and can't sleep alone anymore, I need something else, a drug to poison me to sleep.
DepressDiaries|Why do people try and fix you, when what makes you perfect is your flaws?
DepressDiaries|"As the tears sting my eyes,
I try my hardest not to cry.
Trying to be so perfect in your eyes.
I ask myself, why do I try?"
DepressDiaries|Swallow those tears and pretend you don't hurt.
DepressDiaries|I've learned teddy bears don't make everything okay and crying doesn't make all the pain go away.
DepressDiaries|People you once loved, soon become people you no longer wish to know.
DepressDiaries|"She prays for just one day,
Where she doesn't have to hide behind a smile.
Where she doesn't have to pretend to be okay."
DepressDiaries|"She refuses to trust anyone,
Because she refuses to get hurt again."
DepressDiaries|There's a good side to getting hurt a lot...after a while it just doesn't bother you as much.
DepressDiaries|"I'm different and they know it, 
The hate in their eyes show it."
DepressDiaries|You changed the scenery but the situation is still the same.
DepressDiaries|"She's an artist
A painter actually;
See that ""smile"" on her face?
Well, it's her most famous piece."
DepressDiaries|I may not be perfect by your standards but I'm perfect at being a screw up.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I wish the future wouldn't come...so I wouldn't have to remember the past...
DepressDiaries|Keep the pictures, they'll never change. It's the people in them that do.
DepressDiaries|"Fake a smile,
Don't tell the truth,
Fake a life,
Fake a you."
DepressDiaries|Hate who I was, unsure of who I am, afraid of who I will be.
DepressDiaries|Hiding depression by hiding myself...
DepressDiaries|"Congratulations, you got your wish.
You battered and bruised me, without raising a fist."
DepressDiaries|"I'm a puppet on strings
I'm a girl without wings
I'm societies creation 
Restrained by their label"
DepressDiaries|There's nothing more addictive than memories.
DepressDiaries|Just when you think you've finally hit bottom, someone throws you a shovel.
DepressDiaries|"She hides in the shadows
Her name is unknown
When she looks in the mirror
Her face is my own"
DepressDiaries|I cut, so what? I'm just a regular girl expressing her feelings the only way she knows how.
DepressDiaries|"I know how it feels,
To be on the edge of you bed,
Your head buried in your hands,
Wishing everything would just end."
DepressDiaries|"I don't sit in silence because I like it,
I sit in silence because it's safe."
DepressDiaries|Go ahead sweetie, smile just to brighten someones day... even if you can't brighten your own.
DepressDiaries|I hit the bottom and I don't even care, You say I'm going to hell, but I am already there.
DepressDiaries|No I don't cry on the outside anymore.
DepressDiaries|Why do you ask me what is wrong when the answer is written in my skin?
DepressDiaries|Losing trust of everyone around you is realizing you can only depend on yourself.
DepressDiaries|"I'm nothing special to him. 
I'm nothing special. 
I'm nothing."
DepressDiaries|Some people want to change the future.... I want to change the past...
DepressDiaries|"Nobody ever noticed her
Nobody ever cared
Nobody ever thought that one day
She wouldn't be there"
DepressDiaries|I spend all my time trying to fix what's wrong in my life instead of actually living it.
DepressDiaries|There comes a point in ones life when things get too much to bare, and when that point hits, it hits hard.
DepressDiaries|The thing that people seem to notice that I've accomplished the most, is failure.
DepressDiaries|"I laugh when I want to cry,
I smile when I want to frown,
I'm living and I want to die,
I'm up and I'm going down."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I yell, but its only because I can't cry in front of you.
DepressDiaries|I lock reality out of the room and sit in a peaceful solitude that doesn't exist.
DepressDiaries|I see beauty in destruction; Perfection in corruption.
DepressDiaries|Just when the wounds are almost healed, somebody comes along and tears them wide open again, forcing you to feel the pain again.
DepressDiaries|Some things can't and shouldn't be fixed. It's over for a reason, and deep down inside, you probably know what that reason is.
DepressDiaries|"She looks in the mirror
And sees nothing beautiful
All she sees is the shadow of a girl who died along time ago"
DepressDiaries|Whoever thought you could break more than once?
DepressDiaries|Tomorrow is never better...it only gets worse.
DepressDiaries|She wants to be in a place where she is loved...
DepressDiaries|She just doesn't feel worthy enough to tell anyone her feelings.
DepressDiaries|How can I possibly be happy with the body God gave me when there are so many people with better ones?
DepressDiaries|The lies you tell yourself are your medicine to forget the past.
DepressDiaries|Who needs knives, I've got the last words you said to me... and they're as sharp as ever...
DepressDiaries|Nothing I do makes a difference anymore. So why do I bother trying?
DepressDiaries|I'm happier on my own that way no one can get hurt.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes words aren't enough to express how depressed you truly are.
DepressDiaries|The screaming in my head must be a sign I've held on too long.
DepressDiaries|Secrets are walls that keep us alone.
DepressDiaries|"Wiping the tears from her eyes.
Some days she feels like dying
And some days its not worth trying.
She gets so sick of crying."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes we're broken and we don't know why.
DepressDiaries|I just don't get the point in life... I really don't.
DepressDiaries|I can't forgive until I can fully heal. That's if I can heal at all...
DepressDiaries|Wrapping your arms around your own body, to try and feel what it's like to be loved.
DepressDiaries|I feel like memories are scratches on my soul and promises are broken pieces of my heart.
DepressDiaries|Letting go isn't giving up, its accepting that some things aren't meant to be.
DepressDiaries|I try hard to fit into this world but everyone in it keeps pushing me out...
DepressDiaries|It's getting harder to survive by myself.
DepressDiaries|And when I look in the mirror I tell myself, drop the fake smile and cry, because you're dying from pretending.
DepressDiaries|Every daughter in this world is given the birth right to simply love and be loved by her father. But sometimes, that right is never granted.
DepressDiaries|Lost in a fogotten world with no one left to find me.
DepressDiaries|If the truth is supposed to hurt the most, then why are your lies hurting me more.
DepressDiaries|People you once loved, soon become people you no longer wish to know.
DepressDiaries|"She prays for just one day,
Where she doesn't have to hide behind a smile.
Where she doesn't have to pretend to be okay."
DepressDiaries|She refuses to trust anyone, because she refuses to get hurt again.
DepressDiaries|"The silent cries,
Will force her into things,
No one has ever thought to think."
DepressDiaries|She makes herself picture perfect on the outside, because what's hidden on the inside is much more than she can ever explain.
DepressDiaries|"I'm a strong girl who keeps herself in line.
When I drown myself with tears,
I still manage to say I'm fine..."
DepressDiaries|The things I do will never stay but the words you said will always remain…
DepressDiaries|I don't understand. Life is just one shitty thing after another. It never stops...and I don't understand why you can never get a break.
DepressDiaries|I'm standing on the THINEST line between giving up and seeing how much more I can take.
DepressDiaries|As the wall of lies comes crashing down around me I am revealed for what I truly am, a vulnerable child lost in a world she never understood
DepressDiaries|Why is it called living when I feel so dead inside?
DepressDiaries|I can take the hate. It's the love that hurts.
DepressDiaries|I like life, just not mine.
DepressDiaries|She wraps her arms around her knees, and she whispers why me?
DepressDiaries|I wish someone would have warned me that life was this hard.
DepressDiaries|Your fatal words spread through my veins and went straiqht to my head.
DepressDiaries|"I've got anger built inside,
To hurt to let go, to scared to let out"
DepressDiaries|Silence: Peaceful to the eyes; harmful to the mind
DepressDiaries|"Just a few kind words could save her.
Just a few more unkind words could kill her."
DepressDiaries|I wanna go back to believing in everything... And knowing nothing at all.
DepressDiaries|I just wish some memories didn't last forever. I swear reliving the same moment time after time will destroy you.
DepressDiaries|I just have no energy inside of me anymore to even care.
DepressDiaries|You call me weak because I cry. But if you went through one day of my life, you'd realize crying's the strongest thing I can do.
DepressDiaries|Its like the world is trying to tell me that it doesn't need me anymore.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes the only way to protect the people you love is by staying away from them.
DepressDiaries|I'm so not normal.
DepressDiaries|Netflix, I blame you for this because you added Gilmore Girls thus causing my investment in their relationship. This is all your fault.
DepressDiaries|Yes, I get too invested in fictional characters in literature and movies. I can't help it.
DepressDiaries|For some reason Rory &amp; Logan's breakup makes me incredibly sad. I know it's not right for her but I just wish it were. He loves her so much.
DepressDiaries|"An everlasting sleep is what I truly need
So all these thoughts inside of me can no longer breed"
DepressDiaries|"Crying tears of acid
Burning and yearning
Begging and pleading
I'm dead yet still alive"
DepressDiaries|And I know the pain will never go away, but I can still force a smile and blink the tears away.
DepressDiaries|"I've told you I don't care what you say,
Yet why does it hurt this way..."
DepressDiaries|It's my pain. My pain. This is private. This is personal. These lines are mine. This pain is mine. It's my secret.
DepressDiaries|You should know by now not to leave her alone, she is only going to be tortured by the dark, loneliness &amp; a thousand images of friends lost.
DepressDiaries|I should have known better. Why would this time be any different then all the others...
DepressDiaries|Smiles and laughter choke back tears and sorrow.
DepressDiaries|"Nobody will ever understand
These feelings that I'm going through.
They're slowly taking over me, 
And everything I ever knew..."
DepressDiaries|"I sat still in darkness,
Afraid of the light,
As I slept in the shadows,
And wept in the night."
DepressDiaries|"I'm Afraid.
Afraid that this is all there is."
DepressDiaries|Laugh all day, cry all night, thats when you know, you're losing life's fight.
DepressDiaries|You took away my happiness and let me live this lie.
DepressDiaries|"No one can see through my disguise
A helpless girl screaming through her eyes"
DepressDiaries|"Everything I am, 
And everything I do, 
Is a reflection
Of the hell you put me through."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I believe that the world would be much better if I wasn't a part of it.
DepressDiaries|When you ask her how she is, and she tells you that she's fine, what she's really trying to say, is that it couldn't get any worse.
DepressDiaries|"She's the girl who can't trust.
The girl whose scars tell a story.
She's the girl whose never been good enough."
DepressDiaries|Words aren't enough to explain what I feel, tears aren't enough to release what is kept inside...
DepressDiaries|"When you start to pull your hair out
To keep from reaching for a knife
I'll laugh out loud once again proud
To say, ""Welcome to my life"""
DepressDiaries|"My mask is cracked,
My smile is faded,
My lies are becoming unreal
You start to ask questions
Just because the true me is starting to reveal"
DepressDiaries|The way I see it is that each scar tells a story, and from the way my body looks, I got a hell of a lot of stories to tell.
DepressDiaries|Is life really worth all this pain?
DepressDiaries|I said I wanted to grow up, not become a whole different person.
DepressDiaries|Pain has no warning sign, it just enters and escapes leaving a gaping hole...
DepressDiaries|"Oh, Don't Worry...
You Didn't Break Me, 
No, Sweetie..
You Completely 
Destroyed Me."
DepressDiaries|The only problem with me is that I am the problem.
DepressDiaries|"She's waiting for you to give her a reason to stay.
A reason to continue to live in this hell.
A reason to continue to get her heart broken."
DepressDiaries|I've felt this pain for so long, I forgot what it's like to be happy.
DepressDiaries|I would look on the bright side if I could find it.
DepressDiaries|Isn't it lonely when you know no one cares?
DepressDiaries|"I am who I am, or so it seems,
I think I'd be a better person if I was never seen."
DepressDiaries|Not seeing a future, living meaningless....where am I going?
DepressDiaries|"No matter how bright the room may be, 
It's always darkened by the presence of me."
DepressDiaries|And its raining every night on my pillow when I start wondering if I should be here.
DepressDiaries|I'd rather feel anything instead of this emptiness.
DepressDiaries|And the stars in my eyes that once shined so brightly have fallen...
DepressDiaries|"She sees an image of perfection
Inside her broken reflection."
DepressDiaries|"The girl inside my mirror has fallen to the floor
The girl inside my mirror isn't crying anymore"
DepressDiaries|Wishing on a fading star, wishing it could remove this scar
DepressDiaries|"Alcohol and nervous wits
Razor blades and bloody wrists
Deceiving eyes trapped in lies
Can't escape their painful cries"
DepressDiaries|Where did I go wrong, who was I supposed to be?
DepressDiaries|Pain has become closer to me than any person ever will be...
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I look in the mirror, and wish I could see nothing.
DepressDiaries|There's a smile on my face but I don't know why it's there... I put it on to satisfy all the people that don't even care.
DepressDiaries|"My eyes are sore from crying
My wrist is sore from cutting
Myself is sore from living"
DepressDiaries|What hurts more than no one understanding me, is no one trying to understand.
DepressDiaries|Fade into the background. That's the only place you'll ever fit in.
DepressDiaries|You're not alone; just surrounded by people who will never understand your pain.
DepressDiaries|"She finally gave up on being strong,
One last breath and she was gone."
DepressDiaries|Why do we try so hard, even though we know it won't work out?
DepressDiaries|How many tears can you cry before there's nothing left of you?
DepressDiaries|I feel like I'm losing everything I've ever known. This is what happens when secret emotions are shown.
DepressDiaries|"Cutting doesn't hurt, 
Cutting is the only thing that doesn't hurt"
DepressDiaries|In the end of it all, who am I living for?
DepressDiaries|I'll smile forever, if it stops the questions.
DepressDiaries|Right now I just wish someone would take me out of this dark place and save me from myself.
DepressDiaries|So many tears I can't see the lies, so many lies I can't see the truth.
DepressDiaries|You say I've changed; Sorry but you never really knew me in the first place.
DepressDiaries|"I'm a disaster in heels, 
A living mistake.
I've held on so long, 
My grip starting to break."
DepressDiaries|If she could show you how much you hurt her... you'd never be able to look her in the eyes again.
DepressDiaries|I didn't choose to feel this pain, so why is it here? And when is it going away?
DepressDiaries|I'm broken and you can't put me back together because pieces of me are missing.
DepressDiaries|My scars admit to all the mistakes I've made.
DepressDiaries|If I'm so emotionless, why does it still hurt?
DepressDiaries|I'm more aware that I'm going to die someday, and less aware that I'm living now.
DepressDiaries|"I'm sick of crying myself to sleep
I'm sick of cutting myself so deep
I'm tired of asking myself Why
I'm tired of feeling like I want to die"
DepressDiaries|"Can you see beneath her eyes?
Deep inside where she crys.
Her life caught in between a web of lies,
Up until the day she dies,"
DepressDiaries|"You don't care that I'm here...
So don't cry when I'm not..."
DepressDiaries|Absently smiling through the tears you don't see because the pain I feel you couldn't understand.
DepressDiaries|Even those that do cut rarely know what caused them to resort to it in the first place.
DepressDiaries|There's no way to understand why a person would start cutting if you have never done it yourself.
DepressDiaries|I used to think, a smile was only as happy as I make it, but now, a smile is only as happy as I fake it.
DepressDiaries|The world would go on, nothing would change. No one would notice a boy died from his pain.
DepressDiaries|The hardest part of life is not knowing what is really going to happen in the end...
DepressDiaries|"Another wasted day.
Another sleepless night.
Another blade out of the box.
Another mark across my skin.
When will this nightmare end..."
DepressDiaries|"I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul"
DepressDiaries|"I am only a face
I have no name
This way no one knows
Who's to blame"
DepressDiaries|"Look between the lines...
Look behind the smiles..."
DepressDiaries|"I feel like I'm losing everything I've ever known.
This is what happens when secret emotions are shown."
DepressDiaries|Being able to survive it, doesn't mean that it was ever okay.
DepressDiaries|Do you ever get the feeling that no matter how hard you try, you'll just never be good enough for anyone?
DepressDiaries|I am nothing more than fake smiles and beautiful scars.
DepressDiaries|"Pain Clouds Her Eyes
Dark Thoughts Creep Into Her Mind
Reaching Out For Something To Hold Onto
Something So Impossible To Find"
DepressDiaries|Don't worry, I don't expect you to love me when I don't even like myself.
DepressDiaries|And if one day I actually start to matter, please let me know.
DepressDiaries|Each time I look at a picture of myself, I can remember the happiness that I once had but can't feel the person that I once was at one time.
DepressDiaries|Her hardest problem is letting go of all the lies that she once believed, and still wishes had been true.
DepressDiaries|"I'm trying to find my way
Trying to make it through the day
Trying to make it with no fears
Trying to make it with no tears"
DepressDiaries|Let's start an epidemic: smile like you're not dying inside.
DepressDiaries|"I can't stand looking in the mirror
Because all I see is a failure"
DepressDiaries|"Waterproof mascara and band aids won't do
The make up still runs
And the blood still bleeds through"
DepressDiaries|Lost, in my own pathetic sadness.
DepressDiaries|"Do you know what its like to walk in my shoes?
Please stop judging me simply because I'm not you..."
DepressDiaries|"Do you know what it's like to be me?
To go through something not everyone can see."
DepressDiaries|"So many suicidal thoughts
So many tears left unshed
For each tear that doesn't fall from my eyes
You'll see a cut there instead"
DepressDiaries|If beauty is truely only skin deep, how far must I cut until my ugliness fades away?
DepressDiaries|I've lied so much to myself, I don't know what is real anymore. I've lost a sense of reality, I begin to wonder if my memory is real or not.
DepressDiaries|There is nothing more addictive, than a wound self inflicted.
DepressDiaries|I'm never safe, not even in my own skin.
DepressDiaries|And the only reason you're alive is because it's illegal to kill you.
DepressDiaries|"And I'm not proud of being the way I am.
I just accept the fact that I'm not who everyone wants me to be."
DepressDiaries|Sometimes we need to be hurt in order to realize that once we were happy.
DepressDiaries|"I hate my insecurity 
I hate how I choose to be
I hate the pointless tears I cry
But most of all, I hate being me"
DepressDiaries|"The lies have become her best friend,
Because the truth is her worst enemy."
DepressDiaries|"It's better to pretend,
Rather than show you're really hurt,
And have to explain why to everyone."
DepressDiaries|I try to be perfect in your eyes but all you see are my imperfections.
DepressDiaries|"I crawl under the covers and fall apart.
For I cannot cope with what is my past..."
DepressDiaries|"As darkness spreads, and the light does fade
The pretty picture of my life starts to Break."
DepressDiaries|You don't know http://t.co/zWlJ94VbYi
DepressDiaries|I'm the only person http://t.co/Zyjh024zz4
DepressDiaries|To beg God to take it all away http://t.co/iXthLcnNWj
DepressDiaries|No one asked me http://t.co/tYpPNMmkQx
DepressDiaries|I'm afraid http://t.co/098Q5SYJtI
DepressDiaries|Broken things http://t.co/C6jM6w3QFS
DepressDiaries|Fighting Depression http://t.co/KaSkofNlGD
DepressDiaries|"Why can't I let go?
The question haunts my mind.
And each day as I hang on more,
Answers get harder to find."
DepressDiaries|These scars are getting deeper and after awhile people quit looking.
DepressDiaries|I'm fine with people not liking me... What hurts, is that they lie about it...
DepressDiaries|Just because you are through with your past doesn't mean your past is through with you.
DepressDiaries|I try so hard to please, but it's a waste of time. I'm just the disappointment in your life you can't get rid of.
DepressDiaries|I'm losing myself to the person I'm not.
DepressDiaries|"I haven't smiled today,
or yesterday
or last week
or last month
or maybe I can't remember..."
DepressDiaries|"I'm too strong to stay here, yet too weak to leave.
I'm too strong to hold it, yet too weak to breathe."
DepressDiaries|"Depression...
It's kind of like it's something living inside you. 
Something you cant get rid of because
Killing it means killing you."
DepressDiaries|"Dear God,
What did I ever do to you for you to put me through this?"
DepressDiaries|Thank you, not just for making me worthless in your eyes but in mine too.
DepressDiaries|Is there any hope for me? Even my fantasies end up in tragedy.
DepressDiaries|"I've survived chapters in my life;
Now, when will the story end?"
DepressDiaries|My secret was an echo, and nobody even heard me.
DepressDiaries|"The darkness suffocates me. 
It haunts my dreams and 
Destroys my waking hours"
DepressDiaries|Her eyes screamed the saddest apology anyone had ever heard.
DepressDiaries|I would like to stay a secret, like walking in the dark. If no one knows you, no on cares, no one breaks your heart.
DepressDiaries|The only way for you to truly understand what I'm going through is if your only relief comes from pain.
DepressDiaries|"Your silence, it's suffocating,
But your words may be worse..."
DepressDiaries|She feels sad inside, but doesn't know where the pain came from. Or where to start to make it go away.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes people don’t see how much you need them, until you don’t need them anymore…
DepressDiaries|"No matter how hard I try
No matter how well I do it
You will always find something wrong with it"
DepressDiaries|When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see. Nothing but my own mistakes, staring back at me.
DepressDiaries|Trying to open up, but always too shy. Crying and broken; it's easier just to hide.
DepressDiaries|"I take the pain away
With a razor and a knife
You say that I'm crazy
I say I'm saving my life"
DepressDiaries|You can only lie to yourself so long, until it comes true.
DepressDiaries|Cut yourself up like cheap coupons, and say death was on sale.
DepressDiaries|"Though my soul is breaking
It is just easier to lie
And hide the hurt and emptiness
To smile instead of cry..."
DepressDiaries|I only wish I was as invisible as you make me feel.
DepressDiaries|"And although my heart is beating...
I just know that I am dead...
For inside me life is fleeting
But I have no more tears to shed."
DepressDiaries|What do you do when not one thing in your life means enough, for you to want to stay alive?
DepressDiaries|I am the luckiest girl in this world because I have no tears left to cry, nothing left to loose and no one left to leave me behind.
DepressDiaries|Memories are often a huge burden for the one who has to live with them.
DepressDiaries|One part of me is still fighting, the other part of me is already gone.
DepressDiaries|Use me all you want.
DepressDiaries|Out of all the people she could hate...she picked herself.
DepressDiaries|Physical pain is so much easier to bare than emotional torture...
DepressDiaries|She stared at her reflection and softly whispered, I'm sorry I was never good enough for you...
DepressDiaries|At the end of the day, even after everything everyones done to me, the only person I really hate is myself.
DepressDiaries|"My arms tattooed in red,
My heart broken to bits,
My eyes are still crying,
And my soul no longer exists."
DepressDiaries|How can people tell you to just be yourself, when it's yourself no one likes?
DepressDiaries|"Why is it so hard to forget?
Why is it so hard to move on?"
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I feel like it would just be so much easier not to live, just so I don't have to feel the pain of loneliness.
DepressDiaries|I try to block out the old memories as much as I can but sometimes they creep through and I fall apart all over again.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes it hits me all of the sudden.
DepressDiaries|Feel free to use me until I become useless.
DepressDiaries|"I'm scared of being alone...
Yet I push people away.
I'm scared of being hurt...
Yet I wear my heart on my sleaves."
DepressDiaries|"I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through. 
I've never been perfect but niether have you."
DepressDiaries|Being alone is like climbing a mountain, you can see everyone but no one can see you.
DepressDiaries|We cease loving ourselves if no one loves us.
DepressDiaries|@RayRay1092 Thank you so much!! You are such a sweetheart!! 💗
DepressDiaries|No one cares. I don't belong. Not anywhere; I'm not that strong.
DepressDiaries|The scariest sound in the world is the sound of silence.
DepressDiaries|Wouldn’t it be great to wake up one morning knowing someone cared?
DepressDiaries|"Forget the impression that I make
Forget the smiles that I fake
Forget the lies you think are true
Because I'm not the me you thought u knew"
DepressDiaries|Have I mentioned lately how much I love @skinnyanorexic ? She's always there for me, always supports me, she's amazing, I'd be lost w/o her😘
DepressDiaries|"I hate my life.
I want to die
What's the point of being alive?"
DepressDiaries|There comes a point when you have just been so broken so many different ways its impossible to ever be put back together again.
DepressDiaries|If the world rejects me, where do I have left to go?
DepressDiaries|"They tell me to hold on
But the sad reality is that
I have nothing left to hold onto.."
DepressDiaries|I'm so sick of this shit! My followers are my fucking world. I'd do anything to help everyone of u. How do ppl not know how important u are?
DepressDiaries|"You have the right to hate me
But you do NOT have the right to judge me"
DepressDiaries|I can sum all my pain, sorrow, and fear into one word......why?
DepressDiaries|"I am all alone, trapped in my on head.
Wishing to be anyone else but me."
DepressDiaries|"I'm afraid of me, my own thoughts.
So I sit here, paralyzed with fear, unable to move."
DepressDiaries|When the world crashes down around you, smile because at least now theres nothing left to break.
DepressDiaries|Why do I always say I'm fine when its painfully clear I'm not?
DepressDiaries|If I were to give up hate, nothing would be left of me.
DepressDiaries|"Break me. Take me.
Lose control.
Hurt me. Beat me,
Take my soul.
Touch me. Fuck me.
Tear me apart.
Kiss me. Kill me.
Break my heart."
DepressDiaries|I have suffered enough to know that life does not matter anymore.
DepressDiaries|And maybe this is the way it's suppose to be, and maybe I just have to accept that, but maybe, just maybe, I don't want this.
DepressDiaries|Ever wish you could just curl up in a ball, crawl into bed, and sleep forever for the rest of your life?
DepressDiaries|Why are some people blessed with such optimistic brains, while others just want to blow theirs out?
DepressDiaries|I look at my reflection and quickly turn away, and hope to God you don't see what I see in the mirror every day.
DepressDiaries|"Every scream, is a breath I didn't take,
Every scar, is a suicide I forgot to make."
DepressDiaries|"I'm not real nor alive,
I am dead underneath my lies"
DepressDiaries|Words and scars are basically the same thing, they never really fade and you never really forget them.
DepressDiaries|The most dangerous men in the world, are the men who have nothing left to lose.
DepressDiaries|"She won't make it, but won't stop trying,
She feels so alive, but knows she is dying."
DepressDiaries|"She sees life in shades of gray,
She doesn't believe but continues to pray."
DepressDiaries|"It takes a special person to realize that everything about that ""beautiful"" smile of yours is just a coverup for all the hurt and lies."
DepressDiaries|It's sad how we live to die, but it sadder when we want to die to live.
DepressDiaries|My eyes hurt from crying, my heart aches from trying, my wrist burns from cutting and in the end I still have nothing...
DepressDiaries|I never have things to run to, only things to run from.
DepressDiaries|Hug the hurt, kiss the broken, befriend the lost, love the lonely
DepressDiaries|Not a single tear from her eyes...but a million from her heart...
DepressDiaries|Go ahead and walk in my shoes...I bet you'll fall on the first step.
DepressDiaries|Often, I find myself wanting to be alone. But my biggest fear is that I will be.
DepressDiaries|No one knows she's a beautiful suicide.
DepressDiaries|I'm blocking everything out again, because it's so much easier than feeling something.
DepressDiaries|I'm closing my curtains and removing the welcome mat.
DepressDiaries|I'm shutting my doors and putting my walls back up.
DepressDiaries|You can't change someone without destroying who they were.
DepressDiaries|You're just another scar to add to my wrist.
DepressDiaries|And I wanted so much for someone to love me, that I forgot to love myself.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes drugs help ease the pain. But what happens when your savior becomes your disease?
DepressDiaries|"I smile like nothings wrong
You're happy while I play along
I can't play this part much longer
Because this just isn't making me stronger"
DepressDiaries|It is better to hate yourself for being you, then not knowing who you are to hate.
DepressDiaries|"I'm mad at myself, not at you. I'm mad for always being nice,
always apologizing for things I didn't do."
DepressDiaries|So don't ask me if I'm Okay, because we all know that I'm not.
DepressDiaries|You have no idea how deep these scars go and you never will.
DepressDiaries|Don't tell me I'm taking this all too hard, because you are not me.
DepressDiaries|Don't tell me things will be Okay, because they wont.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes all you can do is smile and go on with your day. Hold back your tears and pretend you're okay.
DepressDiaries|I don't consider this a broken home, I consider this a house full of strangers.
DepressDiaries|"The worst feeling is not death
Its knowing that you aren't needed
That you are alone in this world
That you no longer have a reason to live"
DepressDiaries|The taste of regretting yesterday is so strong.
DepressDiaries|She keeps all her thoughts in her head and lets them out each night in a crimson lie.
DepressDiaries|As she looks in the glass reflection of herself she looks up and wonders why she hasn't givin up yet...
DepressDiaries|"Dreams won't come true,
Only the nightmares do."
DepressDiaries|Do they see a girl who thinks the world is full of colors, or the girl who has too much pain to hide.
DepressDiaries|I always wonder people see whenever they look into my eyes.
DepressDiaries|Life keeps giving me reasons to trust no one but me.
DepressDiaries|I didn't give up... I gave in.
DepressDiaries|Never thought emptiness could be a feeling.
DepressDiaries|He wonders what life would be like if he didn't feel.
DepressDiaries|"Death is love, 
Beauty is hate. 
Perfection is blind, 
Pain is fate."
DepressDiaries|I don't want to be alone...but being alone is when I'm truly myself...
DepressDiaries|My mind will erase every detail but my heart will always remember.
DepressDiaries|My inner pain is expressed by how much I smile; the greater the pain, the more I smile.
DepressDiaries|"Slit my wrists and call it quits
I'm just too tired for this shit."
DepressDiaries|Only the best go through the worst.
DepressDiaries|Regrets should be left in the past, otherwise they scar what we have in the future.
DepressDiaries|I want to run away just to see how far I could get before someone found me.
DepressDiaries|I want to be her..needed to be here. Until I realized she wanted to die, and yet a part of me still wants to be her.
DepressDiaries|That girl in the photo, she looked like me..she was me..but I could never be her. She seemed fearless, in control.
DepressDiaries|"I'm one of those girls that
Will listen to you all night,
And wont expect it in return."
DepressDiaries|"I'm one of those girls,
That will smile when they are sad
Laugh when they want to cry
Do things to please people
When it hurts them inside"
DepressDiaries|If you know how I feel then I feel sorry for you.
DepressDiaries|Being alone hurts more than you will ever know, don't tell me it will get better because I have suffered long enough to know that it won't.
DepressDiaries|I look up when I walk so the tears won't fall.
DepressDiaries|Isn't it a shame when you're supposed to be alive, but you don't see the point in even living?
DepressDiaries|Why is it that everyone tells you to open yourself up &amp; talk, but when u finely say what you're feeling inside they don't want to hear you.
DepressDiaries|It's hard to live when the whole world's against you.
DepressDiaries|"I'm not the same.
I look the same.
Sound the same.
But, my smile's not as real as it used to be."
DepressDiaries|When someone really loves you, they will never hurt you. And if they do, you can see it in their eyes that it hurts them too...
DepressDiaries|Going through life, is like writing with a pen, you can't erase your mistakes.
DepressDiaries|So clean everything up, don't leave any trace. You can't let anyone know what happened to your beautiful face.
DepressDiaries|I no longer remember the face behind this mask.
DepressDiaries|I'm a happy person, all you have to is take away the pain, and the tears and add a smile.
DepressDiaries|Being loney is one thing, but being left alone is another. We feel lonely because we are left alone.
DepressDiaries|I use to beleive in fairy tales.....but then I found out dreams were meant for sleeping.
DepressDiaries|The point where it all becomes so numb. There are tears spilling down your cheeks &amp; you're not even crying anymore, you're just breathing
DepressDiaries|I don't want to talk about it anymore because that means its real...just let me believe its not for one minute.
DepressDiaries|Memories can be erased, but scars are shown forever.
DepressDiaries|For every scream that someone ignores is a little more I die inside and cut my wrists... waiting for the day someone cares...
DepressDiaries|Life is at its worst when you've become exactly who you've promised yourself you'd never be..
DepressDiaries|My screams shattering the silence, does my suffering satisfy you?
DepressDiaries|"The Hurt is no longer a phase,
Even though it cuts so deep.
But instead of holding on,
This time I'll let it bleed...."
DepressDiaries|In my search for the truth, I became a lie.
DepressDiaries|I fear that if I close my eyes I might wake up again.
DepressDiaries|Nothing makes us so lonely as our secrets.
DepressDiaries|Where do you run, when the person you're trying to run from is you?
DepressDiaries|Sleep is good, death is better but best is never to have be born at all.
DepressDiaries|Optimism is just a form of denial.
DepressDiaries|Stick and stones may scar my skin...but words slice right through my soul within.
DepressDiaries|"My life, My pain,
My secret, My scars,
My body, My tears...
I don't want this anymore."
DepressDiaries|What you call pain...I call my life...
DepressDiaries|I'm everything I hate.
DepressDiaries|"I'm breaking down
There's nothing I can do
I have no will to live
I guess my life is through"
DepressDiaries|Scars are just places memories can call a home.
DepressDiaries|And all the drugs in the world can't save her from herself.
DepressDiaries|Your words are careless yet they mean so much...
DepressDiaries|Ripped to pieces, Torn apart, Broken smile and Shattered heart...
DepressDiaries|The tears I cry are no longer clear, they are drenched with blood and full of fear...
DepressDiaries|You never find yourself until you face the truth.
DepressDiaries|Her whole world was a dark room she just needed someone to turn on the light….
DepressDiaries|I looked in your eyes and saw pain, death, and destruction. I looked in your eyes and saw a reflection of me...
DepressDiaries|Happiness is overrated....because it never lasts.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes I think of you just to save myself.
DepressDiaries|You find one piece of happiness in this world and there is always someone trying to take it away...
DepressDiaries|The tears I cry are no longer clear, they are drenched with blood and full of fear.
DepressDiaries|Compared to this, hell must be bliss!
DepressDiaries|With this knife I'll cut out the part of me, the part that cares for you.
DepressDiaries|Even with their eyes wide open, I still remain unseen.
DepressDiaries|Follow your heart but listen to the scars...
DepressDiaries|Everyone that promises to never hurt you, hurts you more than anyone who wants to hurt you.
DepressDiaries|"God forgive me for my sins
Let the angels open the door
I'm sorry for everything that I did
But in life I just wanted more."
DepressDiaries|I feel like giving up, I feel like letting go, no one knows my secrets, I never let them show.
DepressDiaries|"Truth is turning to lies
Lies are turning to tears
The tears remind me
Of the realization of my fears"
DepressDiaries|If I close my eyes now, I'm not sure if I'll want to open them again.
DepressDiaries|Broke my heart, Hope I die
DepressDiaries|The scars on my arms are not a mark of insanity, but a mark against my battle called life.
DepressDiaries|To cry tears of crimson is to know true pain.
DepressDiaries|"Everyone sees her but nobody knows her...
She screams in her pillow for a better tomorrow..."
DepressDiaries|Why is it that every time I've worked my way to the top, you pull me down to the bottom again?
DepressDiaries|I am a wondering soul, that helps others from the shadows, never to be seen or remembered.
DepressDiaries|@purging_princes @Prettyinthin @ED_Challenges When you DM on Saturday add an extra Yes or No to include the weekly challenge.
DepressDiaries|"Its all the same shit,
Just a different day."
DepressDiaries|I'm so tired of pretending that everything is okay. But my tears are starting to show and my smile is fading away.
DepressDiaries|"“@Prettyinthin: NEW RULES HOW TO DM

#TrickTober http://t.co/HDsDyS6N04”"
DepressDiaries|@hblondesky 30 minutes total by Saturday Oct. 4th at midnight.
DepressDiaries|@Sad_Tendencies No, this is on top of the daily workouts. That's why everyone has 3 days to do it.
DepressDiaries|"#TrickTober Weekly Challenge 
Week 1 http://t.co/zcbqTFG3mZ"
DepressDiaries|September has felt like such a long month. It sucked too. Needless to say I'm not raising my hopes for October.
DepressDiaries|@delicateangeI Isn't a stone like 15lbs?
DepressDiaries|Our goal for #TrickTober is not weight loss. Its to continue helping people to stop binging and just be a little active for those who aren't
DepressDiaries|Ohhh, Tequila...you are a horrible decision maker.
DepressDiaries|Considering you're a television show with high ratings I expect you to show the correct way to do a tequila shot.
DepressDiaries|You've been waiting and the rules for #TrickTober are finally here!!! 😊😊
DepressDiaries|So, thank you 😉😘
DepressDiaries|Imitation is the highest form of flattery.
DepressDiaries|Dirty Dancing is on ABC family #yourewelcome #classic
DepressDiaries|Two more days until the end of #NobingeSept DM your after pics to @ED_Challenges make sure you're wearing the same outfit &amp; same pose!!
DepressDiaries|"Living through hell, for it burns me, 
Loving every second, pain drives me..."
DepressDiaries|"Cursing the skies, for they hate me, 
Screaming at the seas, for they despise me."
DepressDiaries|Being healthy is just a slow form of dieing.
DepressDiaries|The only thing worse than being alone is being alone with so many people around.
DepressDiaries|"Sometimes you gotta wonder,
Sometimes you gotta wish,
Sometimes you gotta think,
There's more to life than this..."
DepressDiaries|I don't think I can ever stand myself up, without the illusion that I'm falling...
DepressDiaries|My tired and broken heart just can't take anymore.
DepressDiaries|I think what messes us up most of the time, is that we have these perfect pictures of how things are supposed to be.
DepressDiaries|You hurt me, and now I hurt myself. So you got what you wanted, I will always be hurting in some way or another.
DepressDiaries|"Someone said to me today ""Why do u act like this?"" I looked at them and said ""Well I guess what you did to me in the past changed my future"""
DepressDiaries|I can talk but what's the use nothing can discribe the pain I hold inside.
DepressDiaries|Body needs food to survive. Mind needs starvation to survive.
DepressDiaries|I just watched my best friend from high school pick out her wedding dress. Crazy how time flies.
DepressDiaries|Longest. Week. Ever.
DepressDiaries|Dr. Jenn is already swearing at them. Oh how I've missed that.
DepressDiaries|And I know you all loveeee my obsession with that show &amp; the wonderful advice I pass on!!! #sorrynotsorry #youknowyouvemissedthis
DepressDiaries|Watching #CouplesTherapy &amp; @DrJennBerman is not in all black for prob the 1st time ever. I don't think producer man is top boss anymore 😊
DepressDiaries|But I'm gonna save it for later I think. Something to look forward to in this super awesome life.
DepressDiaries|I really want to eat the tomato sitting in the fridge really bad.
DepressDiaries|And on behalf of all rape victims I would like to say thank you for the flashbacks &amp; memories. Seeing that word alone can be a huge trigger.
DepressDiaries|What if it destroyed your life sweetheart? Would it still be funny??
DepressDiaries|I dont get involved in other people's business bc obviously its not my business. But one should never joke about rape. Dont cross that line.
DepressDiaries|To see someone accuse another person about playing a rape victim is the most the disgusting thing I have ever seen. Its almost unfathomable.
DepressDiaries|"Lonely and forgotten.
Incomplete and sad.
Slowly losing sanity.
Slowly going mad."
DepressDiaries|I know this feeling, the addiction never left my veins.
DepressDiaries|My biggest fear is being happy again and falling right back down.
DepressDiaries|"I am not better than ""that."" I am ""that."""
DepressDiaries|I've come to terms with my numbness. It may stay as long as it doesn't kill my soul.
DepressDiaries|Why can't you see your own beauty if you can see everyone else's?
DepressDiaries|"She's breaking down and everyone's fading.
It's been too long and she's tired of waiting."
DepressDiaries|And maybe this love wasn't ment to last...started to soon and ended to fast.
DepressDiaries|"She's alive and she's trying not to show it.
But everybody knows it.
Yet something is just killing her inside."
DepressDiaries|"I'm just strong enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride let it fall like rain 
From my eyes tonight I will cry"
DepressDiaries|You are my nameless scar inside.
DepressDiaries|Why do I keep holding on to your memory, when you have already thrown mine away?
DepressDiaries|"This alcohol will choke my tears,
Drown my angry heart.
I'll pretend I'm empty of fears,
That I'm not falling apart."
DepressDiaries|"Tell me I will be okay.
I won't believe you..
But I'll pretend to."
DepressDiaries|Have you ever had someone who made you feel like the happiest person in the world, only then to make you feel like the worst?
DepressDiaries|Wasn't it easier when the Earth was flat and the stars were the doors to heaven?
DepressDiaries|@deadinside_xo You're stronger than you realize sweetheart!! Don't ever forget it! 💕💕
DepressDiaries|Or Matthew Gray Gubler's babies, I'm not picky.
DepressDiaries|I would so have Spencer Reid's babies.
DepressDiaries|@deadinside_xo Congratulations!!! I'm so happy for you!! xoxo
DepressDiaries|"She doesn't want tomorrow to come.
She's afraid that it will be the same as today.
She's afraid that it won't be a better day..."
DepressDiaries|Secretly, I've never hated myself as much as I do now.
DepressDiaries|And I think the thing that hurts the most, is you don't even know I'm in pain.
DepressDiaries|She's trying to forget, everything in her past...
DepressDiaries|"""I'm sorry"" doesn't fix things. ""I love you"" doesn't fix things. Words cannot fix things because actions speak louder than words."
DepressDiaries|@Stefaniii33 It's playing mind games with me!!! I want to break the stupid thing.
DepressDiaries|Digital scales are the devil.
DepressDiaries|Yea, that's why I have 2 back ups!!
DepressDiaries|You are a scale. Your only point in life is to properly weigh things!! U cannot add on 5lbs just bc u don't like the floor or where I stand!
DepressDiaries|@need_sk1nny Just because you can't win the prize anymore doesn't mean u should give up. Keep trying &amp; Remember it's almost October! ❤
DepressDiaries|@need_sk1nny Hey don't be so hard on yourself sweetie! You made it incredibly far I'm really proud of u. U should be proud of yourself too.
DepressDiaries|@GirlFoodLife Yea, follow @ED_Challenges We will post info about October's Challenge at the end of this month!!
DepressDiaries|I look back over my life &amp; remember all the happy times, the fun times, me &amp; my family. Then I realize I'm not remembering...I'm imagining.
DepressDiaries|I'm not ready to die but I'm not yet ready to live either.
DepressDiaries|They say time heals everything...Well I'm still waiting ♥
DepressDiaries|I now know deep inside I will never be whole.
DepressDiaries|"No one knows she's a lost soul.
Searching for a way out.
Only you can save her,
But you never took the time to notice her."
DepressDiaries|I want my life back, just not the pain it comes with.
DepressDiaries|Sooner or later, we all give up, dont we?
DepressDiaries|"She isn't where she is supposed to be,
And the sad part is, she knows it."
DepressDiaries|"She no longer needs someone to push her down,
And make her feel like shit.
She's doing it herself."
DepressDiaries|"It's easier to pretend to be strong
Then to tell everything why you no longer
Can make it through one night
Without crying yourself to sleep"
DepressDiaries|@ED_Challenges @SadandDvpressed She's still in!!
DepressDiaries|We're not releasing any information about October's Challenge until the veryyy end of the month. Sorry guys, I'm just excited!!
DepressDiaries|There are still 9 days left of #NoBingeSept Keep working hard!!
DepressDiaries|I'm really excited for October's Challenge!!! 🎃👻🍂
DepressDiaries|@anonskinny14 @ED_Challenges Now that could be very tricky 😉 Haha
DepressDiaries|@anonskinny14 @ED_Challenges Well we have some ideas but what interests you??
DepressDiaries|I'm so proud of everyone who participated in #NoBingeSept even if you did slip up!! Follow @ED_Challenges so you know October's Challenge! 😊
DepressDiaries|I'm sorry, I can't be who you want me to be.
DepressDiaries|"So, help her stand up strong again,
But this time don't be the one to bring her down."
DepressDiaries|Everytime someone asks me if I'm okay, its just a reminder that I'm not.
DepressDiaries|Why can't we just rewind?
DepressDiaries|"Flashbacks
Streaks of pain
A river of tears 
I've taken an overdose of my mind"
DepressDiaries|Fear is temporary whereas regret is forever...
DepressDiaries|The scale continues to tell the story of my failure.
DepressDiaries|Just because you can't see my pain, doesn't mean it isn't there. I've learned to cover it with excuses.
DepressDiaries|I must stand up straight, hold my head up, smile and fool the world.
DepressDiaries|For you eating is a habit...for me it's one hell of a chore.
DepressDiaries|Life is filled with nothing but broken hearts and shattered dreams.
DepressDiaries|I won't do anything else wrong, but I can't fix who I am.
DepressDiaries|You can close your eyes to things you don't want to see but you can't close your heart to things you don't want to feel.
DepressDiaries|I'm to worthless to even succeed at quitting.
DepressDiaries|The world is beatiuful.... without me...
DepressDiaries|How does every word that anyone says--no matter what it is, good or bad--only intensify the pain even more?
DepressDiaries|Our scars have the power to remind us that the past is real.
DepressDiaries|I'm nothing more than a disappointment to you, not worth wasting your time.
DepressDiaries|You say, it's never too late. But darling, I'm in this too deep...and there's no hope left inside my broken heart.
DepressDiaries|All I do is ache, I can't find any peace of mind.
DepressDiaries|Because messing up takes practice, and on that; I'm well rehearsed.
DepressDiaries|Cold, numb, stressed, tired, depressed... I'm tired of feeling so worthless.
DepressDiaries|Why must you push me down, when I'm already on the floor
DepressDiaries|Far too many scars to handle.
DepressDiaries|@tinyunicorxn I fixed it :)
DepressDiaries|@shanhipperson Then maybe next month will be better.
DepressDiaries|@shanhipperson Take it one day at a time. We're human, we're supposed to screw up. Just try and not give up lovie xoxo
DepressDiaries|"It's half way through September! How are all of you doing with #NoBingeSept ?? 
Remember to DM me if you binge or eat any of the 5 foods!!"
DepressDiaries|How did I ever get this broken?
DepressDiaries|We're a product of our environment.
DepressDiaries|"Used And Abused For Many Years...
Each Time A New Scar On My Heart...
I Hide Myself In My Own Dreams...
So, I Can't Be Torn Apart..."
DepressDiaries|Her Own Thoughts Turned Against Her
DepressDiaries|How can you hide from what never goes away?
DepressDiaries|Every now and then I get tired of listening to the sound of my own tears.
DepressDiaries|What do you do when everyone is begging you to keep going but every ounce of you is screaming to give up?
DepressDiaries|Smiling so big so that no one notices the tears blinked away.
DepressDiaries|If we knew each other's secrets, what comfort we would find.
DepressDiaries|There are no tears left in these eyes. No smile left in these lips. And I no longer know how I can keep going on with life the way it is.
DepressDiaries|"She's breaking down and everyone's fading.
It's been too long and she's tired of waiting."
DepressDiaries|The stupidest mistake in life is thinking the one who hurt you the most, won't hurt you again.
DepressDiaries|"These knives that cut me,
They are inside and out,
Attacking with power,
But wielded with doubt."
DepressDiaries|@RxHappyPills Congratulations!! I hope you're proud of yourself!! You're doing amazing, keep going! xoxo
DepressDiaries|You are my nameless scar inside.
DepressDiaries|It's happening, just like last time, I'm back in this lonely state of mind, where the walls are caving in and I'm losing my breath.
DepressDiaries|I'm fading away, soon I'll be just a feeling, I'll be the cold breeze you feel, as you walk home late at night.
DepressDiaries|A memory is a way of holding onto the things you love, the things you are and the things you never want to lose.
DepressDiaries|With my loneliness, I'm never alone.
DepressDiaries|She's scared to show the real her, because what if the real her isn't enough?
DepressDiaries|@lifecanbetoughx You can DM me about that sometime if you want xo
DepressDiaries|❤❤ September 11, 2001 Always in our Hearts, Never Forgotten ❤❤ 🇺🇸
DepressDiaries|I hide my scars because you don't have the right to know the trick to life.
DepressDiaries|Depression is a fancy way of saying that you're dying inside.
DepressDiaries|I need someone to save me from all that I am.
DepressDiaries|Here in my web of dreams; my whispers turn to screams.
DepressDiaries|The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.
DepressDiaries|Refuse to feel anything at all, refuse to slip, refuse to fall, can't be weak, can't stand still, watch your back because no one else will.
DepressDiaries|"My smile doesn't always mean ""I'm happy."" Sometimes it means ""I can manage,"" but sometimes it just means ""I'm tired of crying."""
DepressDiaries|You become an expert on your own body as you slowly destroy it.
DepressDiaries|How are you supposed to explain to your friends that you've lost your will to live?
DepressDiaries|Reduced back to my old ways as yet again I'm thrown to the dirt...
DepressDiaries|"Lose ourselves in open waters
Always swimming back to shore
My addictions have no bounderies
Now I'm crying out for more"
DepressDiaries|"I forget to dream in color
I am better off alone
Honest hearts are undercover
We are shadows on our own"
DepressDiaries|"I try to find myself
I find the stranger trapped inside
And I'll take one more step away
From the face I used to recognize"
DepressDiaries|...And some moments should be left unshared, left in the dust, never brought to others care.
DepressDiaries|I wish I were really as invisible as you make me seem.
DepressDiaries|Sticks and stones may break her bones, but names could make her starve herself to death.
DepressDiaries|"Let the alcohol course through my veins,
Let it break my will and take the reins...
Alcohol is a dangerous heaven"
DepressDiaries|"When am I going to realize that everthing I keep holding on to is nothing...
Everything I fight for is nothing...
I am nothing."
DepressDiaries|You drown in the tears you don't shed...
DepressDiaries|"If you ask yourself the question, is it really worth the pain?
The answer might surprise you because the sun is worth the rain."
DepressDiaries|I am just waiting for a better day.
DepressDiaries|A teardrop is insignificant in a pool of water but it can touch the soul as it runs down someones face.
DepressDiaries|"The happiness comes
The happiness goes
The hightest of highs
To the lowest of lows"
DepressDiaries|@bitethecrave You're my absolute favorite 💜 Pleaseee come and live with me just like we planned!! I love you 💜
DepressDiaries|@britne_lynn Aww yes, thank you 😊
DepressDiaries|Well today has sucked.
DepressDiaries|Boy it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has. But man, it takes a lonely girl to wish that she had never dreamt at all.
DepressDiaries|"""You teach people how to treat you.""

...think about that...think about it long and hard..."
DepressDiaries|I am just a girl that is waiting 'til the seconds stop for me.
DepressDiaries|Life is both a curse and a gift. Good and bad things happen, it's just the bad things happen more often than the good.
DepressDiaries|"@selfharm_NL Most likely they waited until the 2nd trimester to make the ""official"" announcement; which happened to be today :)"
DepressDiaries|And Prince Harry, I am still willing to marry you.
DepressDiaries|Seriously though, can it please be a girl this time??
DepressDiaries|The Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant again! I find this exciting because she basically becomes the most beautiful pregnant woman ever.
DepressDiaries|She's sick of being the one to always make the effort.
DepressDiaries|How can you crave to be alone...and yet alone is the only thing you ever feel...
DepressDiaries|"Leave them before they leave you,
Don't meet anyone new or you'll just hurt them too."
DepressDiaries|Bruises made by hands that are supposed to bring love.
DepressDiaries|"In my corner I shall wait
In the night I'll shed my tears
She will simply stand there
Smiling at my pain and fears"
DepressDiaries|Apology? I'm sorry but I have no regrets.
DepressDiaries|But the ones that could care less about anything somehow get everything.
DepressDiaries|The ones that dream the most, are the ones that never get there happily ever after.
DepressDiaries|We all live in fairytales, just some of us are the lonely girl that don't make it to the end.
DepressDiaries|Thinking, Dreaming, Wishing...Its All I Ever Seem To Do Now...
DepressDiaries|@cantlosenothing I know that feeling, it's one of the worst. I'm here if you need anything. xo
DepressDiaries|@forgettxble Aww thank you, that means alot to me you're so sweet!! If you ever need anything, even just to talk, I'm always here for you. 💗
DepressDiaries|@forgettxble Why love?
DepressDiaries|@cantlosenothing Why hopeless?
DepressDiaries|How has this past week made you feel?? #NoBingeSept
DepressDiaries|The first week of #NoBingeSept is almost over!! I'm so proud of all of, especially those who are still continuing despite the prize!!
DepressDiaries|I just want to be thin. I'm not naive, I know it won't make me happy. But it's just what I need right now.
DepressDiaries|I look in the mirror to find something beautifull but all I see is me.
DepressDiaries|"I take a pill
To catch a thrill
To feel something,
Something that's real"
DepressDiaries|Everything you have you lose. No matter how hard you grab onto something, you still lose it.
DepressDiaries|"""Sometimes people have to cry out all their tears to make room for a heart full of smiles."""
DepressDiaries|I may be the only girl who understands you but it does't mean I'm your soulmate. It means I experienced life.
DepressDiaries|This world is such a terrible and unfair place.
DepressDiaries|"Don't promise me the world,
For the world has cast me into darkness.
Just promise me you won't do the same."
DepressDiaries|Feeling lost is the one thing I am good at.
DepressDiaries|Of course, I don't really have anything stellar planned for October.... I'm starting to see a common theme developing
DepressDiaries|I just wish September would be over. It just feels like a bad month. Idk.
DepressDiaries|You have to stop being both my umbrella and rain.
DepressDiaries|You think you know me, but you're wrong. You don't know me at all. I don't want to die, I want to escape.
DepressDiaries|Don't wake up the girl who has tear stains on her face. Let her sleep because she's hoping she'll die.
DepressDiaries|Why is saying you need help so hard, but writing it down is so easy?
DepressDiaries|"How dare you say you care
When you're never ever there"
DepressDiaries|When pain starts to make you feel alive...you know you've crossed the point of no return.
DepressDiaries|The only one who understands me, lives in my mirror.
DepressDiaries|I never imagined life could be this bad.
DepressDiaries|Wouldn't it be cool if the world cared as much about mental illness as it does cancer???
DepressDiaries|@thinkisses Yea, the whole cultish thing I hate!! They always say white girls in uggs drinking Starbucks. Like please stop stereotyping!
DepressDiaries|PLEASE REMEMBER TO DM ME IF YOU HAVE BINGED OR ATE ANY OF THE 5 FORBIDDEN FOODS!!! Thank you!!! 💕💕 #NoBingeSept
DepressDiaries|@societys__bitch I like to help when I can lol :)
DepressDiaries|Fact: I have never been to Starbucks and it's my life goal to never go to one. So all info is just for you lovelies!!

DepressDiaries|Look in the mirror, no hope is left, too weak to renew, too strong to forget.
DepressDiaries|What use is it to live when on the inside you're dead?
DepressDiaries|Why does the eye see more clearly in dreams, Then the imagination when awake?
DepressDiaries|Friends are just your enemies with a smile on their face.
DepressDiaries|Crying tears that will never appear.
DepressDiaries|There's a good side to getting hurt a lot...after a while it just doesn't bother you as much.
DepressDiaries|"This will be the last time
I’ll tell the story of each vein
I’ve learned my lesson finally
People don’t want to see my pain"
DepressDiaries|One of the worst feelings in the world is to stop for a minute, look back on your life and regret coming this far..becoming who you are now.
DepressDiaries|"I'm different and they know it, 
The hate in their eyes show it."
DepressDiaries|"It kills me inside to see you sad
But I'll do anything to help you through
I couldn't save myself I'm afraid
So I'll try my best to save you"
DepressDiaries|"Locked in a life of torture,
Someones thrown away the key.
I can't get out, I can't escape,
I'm sick of being me...."
DepressDiaries|"I'm trying to hold on,
But life is slipping away.
Each day it becomes more difficult,
More impossible to stay..."
DepressDiaries|I am nothing more than a broken butterfly. Unable to fly with my wings, i fall to the ground.
DepressDiaries|"She's an artist
A painter actually;
See that 'smile' on her face?
Well, it's her most famous piece."
DepressDiaries|"I want to hurt you.
Like you hurt me."
DepressDiaries|Lord, you know I’ve cried a thousand tears tonight but nothing seems to quench the thirst you keep on craving.
DepressDiaries|@bonybelle @Prettyinthin   Keep your head up gorgeous; People will do just about anything to see you fall.
DepressDiaries|Love me like you want to...instead of like you have to
DepressDiaries|We lose the innocence of childhood, the moment we realize we can die.
DepressDiaries|"Fake a smile,
Don't tell the truth,
Fake a life,
Fake a you."
DepressDiaries|Hate who I was, unsure of who I am, afraid of who I will be.
DepressDiaries|"Now I lay me down to sleep
From your promises that you can't keep
I hope I die before I wake
So I can't give you my heart to take"
DepressDiaries|Hiding depression by hiding myself...
DepressDiaries|If I tell you why I love you, will you tell me why you don't?
DepressDiaries|Don't get your hopes up....not every story has a happily ever after.
DepressDiaries|I'm not afraid to walk through the valley of pain and hate since I'm not afraid to walk the earth alone in my sorrow.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes we have to hurt the ones we love so they can learn.
DepressDiaries|"She hides in the shadows
Her name is unknown
When she looks in the mirror
Her face is my own"
DepressDiaries|Cut me down and make me cry. Tell me I'm not worth it. Tell me I'm never going to make it.
DepressDiaries|I feel like I'm taking two steps forward, just to be pushed three steps back.
DepressDiaries|"I know how it feels,
To be on the edge of you bed,
Your head buried in your hands,
Wishing everything would just end."
DepressDiaries|Anyone who really looks into my eyes can see that I'm a weak little girl just waiting for someone to save me.
DepressDiaries|"I don't sit in silence because I like it 
I sit in silence because it's safe"
DepressDiaries|I feel like memories are scratches on my soul and promises are broken pieces of my heart.
DepressDiaries|I try hard to fit into this world but everyone in it keeps pushing me out...
DepressDiaries|God bless the heavy rain that hides the tears of pain rolling down my face.
DepressDiaries|I try to stay strong and keep up this false pretense but I've fallen so far no longer can it be my defense.
DepressDiaries|Close your eyes, the darkness you see, is the darkness I feel everyday.
DepressDiaries|The only thing the world and I have in common is that none of us care about me.
DepressDiaries|If you look in the mirror and don't like what you see, you can find out firsthand what it's like to be me.
DepressDiaries|Someday crying won't be enough.
DepressDiaries|If you avoid her eyes... you don't see her pain
DepressDiaries|Remember when u were a child &amp; didnt know the words fat, skinny, binge, purge or starve? But u knew the word Love. Oh what a Wonderful World
DepressDiaries|@VegRecovery @bonybelle Idk, I remember @Prettyinthin said something a few days ago about chocolate flav coffee creamer so u should ask her.
DepressDiaries|@SheRevolutionry No problem love. If you need anything use the hashtag or you can always DM any of the of us. xoxo
DepressDiaries|@VegRecovery @bonybelle  Negative on chocolate liquor
DepressDiaries|@SheRevolutionry --to tweet ur daily intake, it could actually end up triggering ppl which would be worse. But do tweet for support &amp; help!!
DepressDiaries|@SheRevolutionry Doing it on Myfitnesspal is the best way to go. If you slip up all you have to do is DM me &amp; let me know. You don't need--
DepressDiaries|@GirlFoodLife I know, I don't think some people understand how triggering their tweets can be to others.
DepressDiaries|Remember #NoBingeSept is actually about learning how to eat healthier!!
DepressDiaries|@0tobethin If you search the hashtag you'll find some helpful tips!
DepressDiaries|"#NoBingeSept 
Please DM me if u have binged or ate any of the forbidden foods. Its very important I know asap so we can properly keep track!"
DepressDiaries|@lovely_please Yes
DepressDiaries|@FightDemons93 Love you too honey! 💖
DepressDiaries|@FightDemons93 And most importantly for them to realize they're not alone and other people understand what they're going through.
DepressDiaries|@FightDemons93 We don't want ppl doing that at all! The goal is to create support for those who binge &amp; help them find healthy ways to stop.
DepressDiaries|Please vote for the previous tweet from @floral_bones It's a really worthy cause for children and only takes 1 minute!
DepressDiaries|@Sufferes I really think I need to delete that now lol
DepressDiaries|@Sufferes **Face Palm** lol
DepressDiaries|"People hate lies, but what they don't realize is that the word ""LIE"" sits right in the word ""beLIEve."""
DepressDiaries|There's a difference between letting go and pretending you've forgotten.
DepressDiaries|Sometimes the lies you tell are less frightening than the loneliness you might feel if you stopped telling them.
DepressDiaries|@rydelsbby Aww thank you so much sweetheart!! xoxo
DepressDiaries|My vision becomes clear only when it's blurred by tears.
DepressDiaries|Why is it the ones that want you the least.....are the ones that are able to hurt you the most?
DepressDiaries|When you're little you look up to your parents for right &amp; wrong, what happens when they mess up your mind, you're not sure where u belong.
DepressDiaries|"Maybe In A Perfect World;
She Would Feel Beautiful."
DepressDiaries|Every daughter in this world is given the birth right to simply love and be loved by her father. But sometimes, that right is never granted.
DepressDiaries|@mygoalisthin I'm sorry sweetie! Steal from a friend or a boy who has a crush on you lol 😉

DepressDiaries|"You tear my heart to pieces,
You completely crush my dreams.
You make me feel so worthless,
It hurts so much more than it seems."
DepressDiaries|The reason she smiles is so you don't go looking for her scars.
DepressDiaries|Rolling down my cheeks, are the tears I tried so hard to hold on to.

DepressDiaries|Okay let's recap #NoBingeSept
DepressDiaries|@s0cial_anxiety_ That's awesome! So many families like pretend they're perfect &amp; don't need help. I'm so happy for you!!
DepressDiaries|@s0cial_anxiety_ That's great!! She may not get it right away, just don't give up on her.
DepressDiaries|@HanaGhussein DM it to @bonybelle
DepressDiaries|@s0cial_anxiety_ It's hard for parents especially to understand. She will come around though. It may take a while but she needs the time. xo
DepressDiaries|@s0cial_anxiety_ I care how you're feeling. And sometimes we just need to know a person does care to help us through the dark times. xoxo
DepressDiaries|@Prettyinthin @delicatedaisyy @bonybelle Get a kids hamburger like @Prettyinthin said &amp; apple slices
DepressDiaries|@s0cial_anxiety_ You are more important than you understand, and you are more loved than you realize. ❤❤

DepressDiaries|@perriiiiiiiiiii DM me :)
DepressDiaries|I love you all and I'm always here for you no matter what. But I also know I don't need to tell any of you that because you already know. 😘❤
DepressDiaries|Irony of it all, the people I love and care about through this account are here because people like you judge them. #youshouldbeashamed
DepressDiaries|Learn who you're speaking to before you judge someone.
DepressDiaries|This acct has ALWAYS been about helping ppl. Whether its depression, mental illness, EDs, etc. I dont give a shit about being twitter famous
DepressDiaries|"“@malcolm_fox2: @DepressDiaries trying to be Twitter Famous is like being rich at Monopoly it isn't real unfollowed and blocked bye”

Wtf???"
DepressDiaries|@lmFatandUgIy Send your picture to @bonybelle
DepressDiaries|@foreversxdness Make sure you DM so I can keep track of binges/mini binges thanks!!
DepressDiaries|It seems odd that I would be smiling after everything just went wrong.
DepressDiaries|Losing trust of everyone around you is realizing you can only depend on yourself.
DepressDiaries|If one more person gets engaged I'm going to kill myself.
DepressDiaries|@caitlinfxo Send your pics to @bonybelle and if you binge or have a mini binge DM me xoxo
DepressDiaries|@littlefitana It's okay, but I know the hashtag will confuse people. Thank you for understanding!! xoxo
DepressDiaries|@littlefitana @littlebabyana If that changes 1 of us will tweet it. Pls don't tweet exercises w/the hashtag, we don't want ppl confused.
DepressDiaries|@littlefitana @littlebabyana We appreciate what you're trying to do but we chose to not include exercise in #NoBingeSept
DepressDiaries|@DemixStarxVato Post with the hashtag or send it to @bonybelle
DepressDiaries|@cutmylifeaway @Prettyinthin @bonybelle I believe we said no. I know @Prettyinthin answered that originally so I pass it on it her 😉
DepressDiaries|@lonelytheteen @Prettyinthin @bonybelle Send pictures to @bonybelle via DM and send information about a binge or mini binge to me via DM.
DepressDiaries|#NoBingeSept was created as a support system.
DepressDiaries|If you know anything about myself, @Prettyinthin or @bonybelle u would know the LAST thing we would ever do is encourage the hell of an ED.
DepressDiaries|@anasemptyghost -with binging, which as you may know often leads to purging. We're supporting those who want to stop the cycle.
DepressDiaries|@anasemptyghost I know I have one. We are in no way encouraging eating disorders. It's actually a support system to help those who struggle-
DepressDiaries|They say chewing ice is a a form of pica, just stay away from chalk and you'll be okay.
DepressDiaries|Tip: Keep a glass of water with plenty of ice in it with you. Chewing ice can help you from going after your favorite foods. #NoBingeSept
DepressDiaries|Labor Day often means fun family picnics! Avoid your trigger foods, and catch up with your family (they miss you.) #NoBingeSept
DepressDiaries|Life is like a box of chocolates- it's a cheap thoughtless perfectionary gift that nobody ever asks for.
DepressDiaries|I don't want to be here but you sure as hell won't be the reson I leave....
DepressDiaries|@depressed144 Sweetheart, all the best people are weird. @Prettyinthin knows more about purging than I do. I'm sure she'll be around today.
DepressDiaries|"Everything happens
For a reason
You just need something
To believe in"
DepressDiaries|@depressed144 There is something sweetheart. You just have to find it and want it bad enough. I know it's hard, just keep looking.
DepressDiaries|No smile is as beautiful as one that struggles through tears.
DepressDiaries|@depressed144 Idk, call a friend, go for walk, Facebook stalk someone? Anything, just try something!!!
DepressDiaries|@depressed144 @Prettyinthin You need to find something to distract yourself. I know it's difficult but I don't want you throwing up blood xo
DepressDiaries|And so #NoBingeSept begins!!! Good luck!! 😘
DepressDiaries|@Prettyinthin Well, I'm guessing they won't be winning then lol
DepressDiaries|REMEMBER: You must Fav the official on @Prettyinthin 's page. If you don't favorite it, you're not officially.
DepressDiaries|@prfctporcelain You're disqualified from winning a prize but you can still continue with the challenge.

NoImdepressed|#Twitterversary
NoImdepressed|@Fact The flag goes to next of kin, as the son is getting it it means both his parents are gone, he's trying so hard to stay strong
NoImdepressed|At night my smile fades as when my eyes close the darkness reminds me of the hole I cannot climb out of.
NoImdepressed|No wounds on my wrist now only scars, time will only tell
NoImdepressed|So I'm not better yet so they failed... But I'm back!
NoImdepressed|Why do all the bad things happen to the good people? Stay strong KH
NoImdepressed|Why does god let me live?
NoImdepressed|I want everyone to know they are beautiful amazing wonderful inspirational generous selfless and much better than me.
NoImdepressed|With all I say on here in real life i am such a hypocrite.
NoImdepressed|"I am a bad person
I am a terrible friend
I am a horrific sister
I am the worst daughter"
NoImdepressed|I need to actually start doing something about me.
NoImdepressed|Look ok so I can't take this anymore. I'm sorry I CAN'T be the strong one anymore. I CAN'T help you with your problems. I can't keep lying.
NoImdepressed|Shame for Leonardo Dicaprio http://t.co/kC42fDiMio
NoImdepressed|Those days when you disappoint yourself more than usual.
NoImdepressed|http://t.co/5xV9bKPpHG
NoImdepressed|I fucking hate my lack of motivation why can't I be motivated like the other girls!? That's why they go skinny and you stay fat bitch!!!!

NoImdepressed|Well I am alone on valentines day again. Anyone else?
NoImdepressed|My friend askd if I jst help othrs &amp; not get help myslf. I didnt wnt to say yes so I said it didnt matter. But she just didnt let it go. Ugh
NoImdepressed|Not that anyone cares my parents left and my best friend forgot.
NoImdepressed|Well it's my birthday.🎈
NoImdepressed|I am such a failure. The thing I'm supposedly best at I just fucked up. Now I have nothing.
NoImdepressed|A life without hope is a life without a future, a life without a light at the end of that long tunnel, the passage to better things.
NoImdepressed|I think about suicide everyday now.
NoImdepressed|Sorry for clogging up you guys' timelines I'm just feeling lonely today
NoImdepressed|You haven't talked to me in so long it's like we aren't friends already. Makes it easier.
NoImdepressed|And that's what they say to you but they are just attention seeking and just think you are dispensable. Well guess what I don't need you.
NoImdepressed|Like seriously not everything is about you!
NoImdepressed|And if you ask why they get all protective and turn on you as if its ur fault!?!?
NoImdepressed|I've just accepted I'm not good enough for them
NoImdepressed|That's like 90% of my friends
NoImdepressed|"Those people who write in Xmas &amp; birthday cards 
'I love u our friendship means so much! BFFs!' 
Then completely ignore you and be a bitch."
NoImdepressed|It's funny how when making others feel better you write a thousand words and when they comfort you it's two 'oh sorry'
NoImdepressed|Well I have just given a friend a hypocritical speech.

NoImdepressed|My friend cuts sometimes just to feel pain but isnt depressed. She has a hard life &amp; I feel im overreacting cuz hers is much worse than mine
NoImdepressed|Dumb fucking talk on depression endin in smiles they dont even kno fucking pissed dont say anythin if u dont fucking understand u fucktards.
NoImdepressed|Silence speaks when words can't.
NoImdepressed|They tried to save me once.
NoImdepressed|"Curiosity killed the cat.
Society killed the teenager."
NoImdepressed|That awful moment when your blades aren't in the place you left them

NoImdepressed|3.5kg left to target weight. Why am I so fat?
NoImdepressed|My heart goes out to all those suffering #staystrong #bestrong 💪 💚

NoImdepressed|I love the feeling of burning. Not just with heat, with blade.

NoImdepressed|I'm going to a self serve froyo place tomorrow. I'm going to need massive self control.
NoImdepressed|The hardest thing is, I used to be in live with food so everyone expects me to eat loads of it.
NoImdepressed|I need to be more persistent, I give up so easily.
NoImdepressed|It was a pool party. Everyone else was so beautiful and skinny in their bikinis and then there was me, the fat Oompa Loompa.
NoImdepressed|Whenever I eat food it makes me feel sick. I guess that's a good thing.
NoImdepressed|I had to eat at my friends party. They were looking at me. Since I can't purge I shall cut tonight.
NoImdepressed|@ImGettin_PAPEr_  just search up personality disorder test :)

NoImdepressed|I'm that girl at school that is always happy and hyper and bubbly. It's just a mask no no one asks.
NoImdepressed|For a week I want to turn off all sources of communication, not go to school and hide away. Just to see who would care if I was gone.
NoImdepressed|Anything I eat now makes me feel sick.
NoImdepressed|Depression is a lot worse than just a feeling. It's a way of life.

imdepressed_xx3|I can't breath
imdepressed_xx3|@codieplz  can you pretty please follow? 😔
imdepressed_xx3|I'm not okay, 3000 miles away
imdepressed_xx3|always http://t.co/rbrlQQVB4N
imdepressed_xx3|stop fucking with my emotions
imdepressed_xx3|Sick of caring about people and them not even thinking one bit about me.
imdepressed_xx3|my scars are fading, so are you, at least I can bring back one of the two
imdepressed_xx3|Bad memories always come back http://t.co/MgCmzn1fws
imdepressed_xx3|I honestly have no idea how many days I'm clean, I haven't been counting
imdepressed_xx3|Serious need for cuddles at the moment
imdepressed_xx3|Just watched like 12 sad movies, I have no tears left
imdepressed_xx3|hopefully I won't procrastinate this week about exercising
imdepressed_xx3|Why am I jealous, he's not even mine.
imdepressed_xx3|False hope shatters your heart and crushes you entirely
imdepressed_xx3|don't text him don't text him
imdepressed_xx3|I will never forgive myself for what I did to him
imdepressed_xx3|don't be desperate love, find someone who will treat you like you are their one and only
imdepressed_xx3|We promised we wouldn't leave, I'm here, where are you?
imdepressed_xx3|I do get jealous but I don't show it because I've hurt you enough
imdepressed_xx3|sometimes I wonder but. Hopes always get crushed, so none. http://t.co/xf6NzkPyd5
imdepressed_xx3|looking through his old tweets trying to imagine them being about me
imdepressed_xx3|I hate knowing that I lied to him
imdepressed_xx3|the human heart is not designed to say goodbye
imdepressed_xx3|sometimes I give up on trying to fix people, because I know they wouldn't bother to fix me
imdepressed_xx3|Only 3,721.3 miles away 😂
imdepressed_xx3|GET OUT OF MY HEAD I CANT HAVE YOU ANYMORE
imdepressed_xx3|Start taking your own advise asshole

imdepressed_xx3|I hate him I hate him I hate him I love him I hate him I hate him
imdepressed_xx3|note to my mother: it's not always my fault
imdepressed_xx3|the dead receive more flowers than those alive, because regret is stronger than gratitude.
imdepressed_xx3|She was so sad about everything she eventually faded away
imdepressed_xx3|Someone please come give me a massage
imdepressed_xx3|Glad everyone else is having a great time
imdepressed_xx3|Ironic isn't that
imdepressed_xx3|Annoyed with everyone but him
imdepressed_xx3|That sad moment when you realize, wow I mean nothing to him, at all
imdepressed_xx3|It's always been you
imdepressed_xx3|If you want to have a interesting conversation with me I suggest 3am time range because I'm much more fun then
imdepressed_xx3|I'm in love with the cities I've never been to and the people I've never met
imdepressed_xx3|Not knowing sucks
imdepressed_xx3|I can't sleep help

imdepressed_xx3|@bleedingeyes10 how much I relate to this is quite insane
imdepressed_xx3|I can't even tell you I miss you, because I know you don't care
imdepressed_xx3|"""I'll be here forever, I promise"" funny how you ARENT FUCKING HERE"
imdepressed_xx3|I'm so tired of fighting for someone who doesn't even care anymore
imdepressed_xx3|I always set myself up for failure, and put my hopes up too high
imdepressed_xx3|Maroon 5 never disappoints
imdepressed_xx3|I can't let go, I'm sorry
imdepressed_xx3|Can I lay by your side, next to you, you

imdepressed_xx3|no one can be trusted anymore, everyone let's you down.
imdepressed_xx3|I know we are millions of miles in between us, but I will come running for you I don't care how far
imdepressed_xx3|I'll never be able to compete with her
imdepressed_xx3|he doesn't care
imdepressed_xx3|They are all about you, every single one of them
imdepressed_xx3|@suixidenote feelings mutual
imdepressed_xx3|Why am I so afraid to lose you? You aren't even mine
imdepressed_xx3|I've tried and tried and I'm sorry but I don't see the point in trying anymore
imdepressed_xx3|-like to talk about? Then I'm basically screwed
imdepressed_xx3|I hate hate hate asking people questions, because what of they think it's weird? What if I touched a subject they don't-
imdepressed_xx3|Lately I feel so drained, like I have no energy to participate in things I used to love, I just want to sleep for awhile
imdepressed_xx3|I miss him so much
imdepressed_xx3|Gosh I miss him
imdepressed_xx3|I promise I don't mean to be annoying it just happens
imdepressed_xx3|God dammit
imdepressed_xx3|Sucks when you are someone's 0 priority, when they are your first 😕
imdepressed_xx3|You don't know rock bottom until you hit it, welcome to the bottom.
imdepressed_xx3|I wish I knew what you felt and it's driving me insane
imdepressed_xx3|but baby how long am I supposed to wait for you?
imdepressed_xx3|What if I fell to the floor? Couldn't take this anymore.
imdepressed_xx3|I miss when he used to call me love and make me smile
imdepressed_xx3|“@INow that I can't feel a thing baby don't feel my pain just smile back.
imdepressed_xx3|I'll leave this world, of my devising

imdepressed_xx3|I want to die so badly
imdepressed_xx3|I keep watching his story over and over because he's fucking perfect
imdepressed_xx3|@goalsofperfect don't doubt yourself too much, you look great ☺️
imdepressed_xx3|@goalsofperfect your legs are perfect 😍
imdepressed_xx3|I'm sorry
imdepressed_xx3|I could really use more long hugs, adventures, and you
imdepressed_xx3|I didn't sleep at all last night
imdepressed_xx3|funny how the people who said they wouldn't leave, left.
imdepressed_xx3|oh darling you can't save me
imdepressed_xx3|what's funny is last time I was the one saying goodbye
imdepressed_xx3|""" I can't have this right now, okay bye"""
imdepressed_xx3|how beautiful is it that someone could make your heart beat so fast when you don't want it to beat at all
imdepressed_xx3|lonelier than the average human
imdepressed_xx3|I'm a worthless piece of shit
imdepressed_xx3|I hate being the only one making an effort
imdepressed_xx3|I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
imdepressed_xx3|FUCK
imdepressed_xx3|Fucking hell god dammit
imdepressed_xx3|Oh god fuck I'm afraid
imdepressed_xx3|Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.
imdepressed_xx3|“@cocainevisions: i need this rn http://t.co/68Ia5PYVSD”please and thank you
imdepressed_xx3|@basicgirlventin I love how the sign says no projects
imdepressed_xx3|I'm scared that one day he will see me the way I see myself
imdepressed_xx3|the worst thing is needing someone who doesn't need you
imdepressed_xx3|why is it so hard to tell someone you love them?
imdepressed_xx3|I miss him a lot and I'm too scared to tell him because he will just tell me I'm being silly
imdepressed_xx3|how did we get to the point in our generations that a number defines whether or not we are happy
imdepressed_xx3|crazy how much you can hate yourself
imdepressed_xx3|Why do I wait for people that wouldn't wait for me?
imdepressed_xx3|no pants to bed are my favorite pants to bed
imdepressed_xx3|In the end, you are you. And there is no way to change that, no matter how hard we may try.
imdepressed_xx3|but I always text him first so I feel like I'm annoying him
imdepressed_xx3|I can't stop thinking about him
imdepressed_xx3|feeling invisible is so stressful
imdepressed_xx3|“@harmfvl: do you see why we self harm now ? http://t.co/Vm9c9o2erR”someone finally said it.
imdepressed_xx3|My cuts on my thigh hurt really really bad right now
imdepressed_xx3|http://t.co/N6ruKiO9ve
imdepressed_xx3|1 cut 2 cut 3 cut 4 blood starts dripping from the tub to the floor
imdepressed_xx3|don't be jealous don't be jealous don't be jealous
imdepressed_xx3|I'm going to Florida in August, better start working out 😂
imdepressed_xx3|I'm so tired of being tired
imdepressed_xx3|my sadness was never beautiful, it is like swallowing 36 pills and laughing like it was fine
imdepressed_xx3|I don't know he feels anymore and that scares me
imdepressed_xx3|what is going on in his head
imdepressed_xx3|don't do it don't do it
imdepressed_xx3|why do I always do that
imdepressed_xx3|It doesn't even matter if I love you more than anyone in this damn world, you don't want me.
imdepressed_xx3|I'm at the point of giving up
imdepressed_xx3|I've lost all motivation to do anything
imdepressed_xx3|http://t.co/lkCF7eUYSn
imdepressed_xx3|I really don't want to eat but I need to so my medication will work ugh
imdepressed_xx3|Merrily we fall out of line out of line, I'd fall anywhere with you I'm by your side
imdepressed_xx3|The most terrifying feeling is feeling like you are alone even if you are surrounded by people
imdepressed_xx3|How is my education more important than my mental health??
imdepressed_xx3|I'm so stressed out from school
imdepressed_xx3|mental breakdown, 3...2...1!
imdepressed_xx3|I also have a tendency to love everything that destroys me
imdepressed_xx3|I was told to promise not to break no matter how far i was bent, little did they know I've been broken for a long time
imdepressed_xx3|yes I am afraid of rejection no you don't need to comment on it
imdepressed_xx3|why did I do it shit
imdepressed_xx3|shit shit shit
imdepressed_xx3|And it hurts so much to want something you can't have
imdepressed_xx3|one terrible feeling is where you feel like your best friends aren't there for you
imdepressed_xx3|I miss him so much
imdepressed_xx3|I don't want to cut I don't want to cut is all I keep repeating to myself but here I am with this razor in my hand
imdepressed_xx3|I have a tendency to fall apart when everyone else is getting better
imdepressed_xx3|I finally got to talk to him today
imdepressed_xx3|Why did I ever lie to him? Why would I do that? Why did I have to fuck everything up?
imdepressed_xx3|I always fuck things up
imdepressed_xx3|you don't need me, and that really hurts
imdepressed_xx3|I'm sick of being me
imdepressed_xx3|crying, shaking, and screaming into my pillow was not planned for tonight.
imdepressed_xx3|I can't stop him. I can't.
imdepressed_xx3|I'm shaking so badly right now
imdepressed_xx3|I hope you don't think I'm totally insane
imdepressed_xx3|I don't even know what to do anymore
imdepressed_xx3|Two days until break is over and I was supposed to type 2 papers and read two books, what have I done? Nothing.
imdepressed_xx3|"I was just about to text him, then I thought ""why the fuck do I even try anymore?"" And didn't."
imdepressed_xx3|Just had the worst nightmare I've had in a long time  😔
imdepressed_xx3|It's 3am and I'm still up, kill me please

imdepressed_xx3|Ignoring me makes me feel fucking great thanks
imdepressed_xx3|I don't know what to do anymore
imdepressed_xx3|please help me the voices are drowning me in thoughts
imdepressed_xx3|it's never to late when love is involved
imdepressed_xx3|he handed me the keys and watched as I drove myself insane
imdepressed_xx3|deleted those tweets because no idea what he would think 😂
imdepressed_xx3|do you think about me as much as I think about you?
imdepressed_xx3|I swear I've been fighting with my mom the last three days
imdepressed_xx3|If I say 'it's whatever' to you it doesn't mean that I'm not pissed at you, it just means I don't want to say it again
imdepressed_xx3|you know what's hard? Taking selfies when you are UGLY AS FUCK
imdepressed_xx3|I have a really bad craving for alcohol right now ..

imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 hello ☺️
imdepressed_xx3|kill me before I kill myself
imdepressed_xx3|I want to kill myself but I'm so afraid of what will happen if I failed
imdepressed_xx3|I can't take it. I can't do it anymore.
imdepressed_xx3|WHAT IS SO BAD ABOUT NOT WANTING TO LIVE ANYMORE, WHY IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING

imdepressed_xx3|darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a nightmare
imdepressed_xx3|It's hard being in love with someone that you know doesn't love you
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I guess I should actually go to sleep now. 😂 goodnight ☺️
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 yes! Woohoo!
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 it was nice talking with you too! Goodnight 😊
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 THAT WOULD LITERALLY BE ME.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I should probably head to bed. I'll talk to you soon/later?
imdepressed_xx3|I can't sleep help
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 or they'll be no fun crazy people
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 tell you it'll be okay.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I hate counseling. Been there done that. (( it was total bullshit by the way)) just people getting paid to,
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I'll be fine. I've gotten through three years without killing myself so that's a start 😂😂
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 my parents wouldn't understand, they would drop me off at a mental institution and leave me there😂
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I'm sorry, but I can't do that. As much as you may want me to, I won't. I'm stubborn as hell.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 it would eventually get to my dad no matter how hard I could try. He would find out.
imdepressed_xx3|@insanityxbones goodnight 😊💕
imdepressed_xx3|@insanityxbones you can be that strong, I thought I wasn't going to be. I know you could do it if you tried ☺️
imdepressed_xx3|@insanityxbones not anymore☺️ I found the easiest way is to throw out two or three a month. It gets easier as you go. 💞
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 freak, and my dad would call me a freak
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I wouldn't be able to do it. My parents split when I was little, total different people. My mom would,
imdepressed_xx3|@insanityxbones I threw them out only a couple at a time, it was a much easier way to let them go.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I never ever can explain it. Like how am I supposed to tell you if I don't even know??
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 exactly!! Like whenever people would ask me how it felt to hurt myself my face was literally ??????
imdepressed_xx3|@Dreaminskinny your body is so pretty ☺️ I think you look great.
imdepressed_xx3|I love it when people talk to me. At home I'm basically invisible to everyone sooo
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 it's a scary thing to think about. Like what happens after you tell them? You don't know until you do it.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I still haven't told my parents, I don't think I ever will. It's been about three years of sh/depression
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 then you know a side to it, it sucks. Total shit. I feel like I'm in a nuthouse but really it's just me 😂
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 but it's not just a snap of the finger thing. It's a daily,monthly, yearly progression and fight.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 yeah, it's pretty sad. But I know both sides and it's hard to control/know what you think from what is real
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 no, that's not what I meant. As in addictions, whether it's self harm, depression, anorexia etc etc.
imdepressed_xx3|I should've went to bed an hour ago, oh well.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 this conversation went from sad, to ultra sad.
imdepressed_xx3|I fight for what I believe in/passionate about until you understand what point I'm trying to make. So good luck 😂
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I look like a hippo times 10, and an ugly...i don't know. ((What's an ugly animal I have no clue))
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 have you ever even been through what we go through on a daily basis? It's total shit.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 if you look at several other of accounts, there are hundreds of boys with addictions of that sort too.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 I'm not out of anyone's league. Just a normal girl that talks to everyone 😂
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 assume I'm taken?? Shocker😂😂
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 -in that state of mind. A tweet doesn't help or do anything.
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 instead of tweeting about it why not help them? I've been there and it's not fun, you always need someone-
imdepressed_xx3|"@motorcop505 ""And others thinking about it"""
imdepressed_xx3|@motorcop505 and boys. Boys cut too. Not just girls.
imdepressed_xx3|I may seem desperate if i text you alot butI promise its because care and I want to make sure you are having a good day😌
imdepressed_xx3|I know I'm a boss ass bitch but I'm still insecure 98% of the time 😂
imdepressed_xx3|wish someone would actually talk to me, I'm not fucking invisible you know.
imdepressed_xx3|I won't ask you for much, only that you'll laugh at my bad jokes and hold my hand every once in awhile.
imdepressed_xx3|save me from my mental sadness please
imdepressed_xx3|why does everything crash down at once?
imdepressed_xx3|my mind is drowning in thoughts of you
imdepressed_xx3|The 1975 makes me so happy
imdepressed_xx3|he gives me all these different feelings that I've never felt before and that terrifies me.
imdepressed_xx3|can I runaway from reality please?😴
imdepressed_xx3|😔 http://t.co/N2sdlxf3dc
imdepressed_xx3|it makes me sad that I have no one to talk to
imdepressed_xx3|school makes me want to kill myself 10x more than I already do
imdepressed_xx3|starting to realize that his opinion doesn't matter.
imdepressed_xx3|someone please save me from this hell school
imdepressed_xx3|the scariest part is not knowing, once you kill yourself you can't control what happens.
imdepressed_xx3|@xhttpsuicidxl happy birthday ☺️
imdepressed_xx3|everytime I go to the dentist they always  mess up my jaw like what the hell are you doing

imdepressed_xx3|the sad thing is, is that he probably doesn't even though most of my tweets are about him.
imdepressed_xx3|It might sound cheesy, but I don't know where I would be without him.
imdepressed_xx3|she's gorgeous 😔 http://t.co/rQw63TRIgW
imdepressed_xx3|I dream of the day when I can go into the small section for myself
imdepressed_xx3|okay who wants to cuddle because I do
imdepressed_xx3|my hands may be cold but I promise my heart is warm
imdepressed_xx3|suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide
imdepressed_xx3|"To you I'm saying goodnight, in my head  I'm screaming "" don't go """
imdepressed_xx3|When all you want to do is day something, but you have no idea how to say it.
imdepressed_xx3|It scares me how much I think about suicide
imdepressed_xx3|not eating is hard when people notice 🙇
imdepressed_xx3|when people don't text you back 😒
imdepressed_xx3|http://t.co/Rn1TzEpsEt
imdepressed_xx3|do you ever just sit there screaming at yourself about everything wrong with you but you are just eating dinner
imdepressed_xx3|when all you hear are slamming doors and yelling in your house..
imdepressed_xx3|If you are going to make me fall for you, at least catch me. Please.
imdepressed_xx3|don't go.
imdepressed_xx3|I know you don't care,and I know you have other plans for your life, but I love you.but I don't think that changes much.
imdepressed_xx3|I just want to scream and cry and be with you all at once
imdepressed_xx3|be real with me, I'll be real with you
imdepressed_xx3|@purginprincess that sounds really really good, make sure you drink water ☺️💞
imdepressed_xx3|I have a twelve hour drive to go back home why the hell am I still awake?
imdepressed_xx3|I always manage to embarrass myself with everyone I talk to so be prepared
imdepressed_xx3|don't you ever just want a real conversation about everything with someone ?
imdepressed_xx3|can someone please come cuddle with me until I fall asleep because nightmares aren't fun alone
imdepressed_xx3|she couldn't find the happiness, so she overdosed on sadness
imdepressed_xx3|If traveling was free you'd never see me again
imdepressed_xx3|call me 'babygirl' or 'princess' I'll marry you
imdepressed_xx3|why does twitter have to be an asshole 97% of the time?
imdepressed_xx3|Please don't let me.. http://t.co/VwWOR1HmT0
imdepressed_xx3|strange things did happen here no stranger could it be🎶
imdepressed_xx3|what doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead
imdepressed_xx3|when you know you are just another person to someone 😒
imdepressed_xx3|When you are always putting someone first and they always put you second 😒
imdepressed_xx3|that moment when you want someone but they want nothing to do with you
imdepressed_xx3|I'm sorry for always saying sorry
imdepressed_xx3|I'm not the kind of person you want to toy with because I'll catch feelings and it won't be good
imdepressed_xx3|48 days until I'm 300 days clean 💪
imdepressed_xx3|but now, he's gone http://t.co/t33eZkM9tT
imdepressed_xx3|call me baby girl and I'll be yours forever
imdepressed_xx3|I am pathetically in love with you
imdepressed_xx3|It's so exhausting to feel nothing and everything at the same time
imdepressed_xx3|why does death seem like such a better choice than life?
imdepressed_xx3|I'm constantly in between killing myself and killing everyone around me
imdepressed_xx3|I feel really bad when I text people and then end up getting to busy to text them. It makes me feel like shit
imdepressed_xx3|the sad feeling you get when you look out of your window and there's almost a foot of snow
imdepressed_xx3|It's probably not a great idea to try to curl your hair while being sad because all you want to do is burn yourself
imdepressed_xx3|I just need a reason to be alive, why don't you realize that?
imdepressed_xx3|little do you know, how I'm breaking while you fall asleep
imdepressed_xx3|don't be scared of love, being loved, or loving someone. It's okay to love.
imdepressed_xx3|he seems happy now, that's all that matters right?
imdepressed_xx3|you have to keep up a fake smile when really you are a fucking mess
imdepressed_xx3|one daySomeone is going to realize that avoiding problems doesn't work when things go wrong with me, they only get worse
imdepressed_xx3|Whenever I try to figure things out, the thought of suicide always comes up
imdepressed_xx3|Why do I even try any more?
imdepressed_xx3|I keep flinching at every move that people make around me
imdepressed_xx3|hold my hand and I'll probably be the happiest person ever ☺️
imdepressed_xx3|When he texts I get this feeling in my stomach and it makes me feel so happy
imdepressed_xx3|and hopefully one day when he needs a reason to be alive he'll remember how much I love him
imdepressed_xx3|I've been thinking about suicide way to much lately
imdepressed_xx3|the urge is coming back
imdepressed_xx3|I'm so angry, sad etc
imdepressed_xx3|I keep thinking about suicide for some reason.
imdepressed_xx3|I hate myself so so much
imdepressed_xx3|the marks humans make are too often scars
imdepressed_xx3|http://t.co/cD1O79jwlW
imdepressed_xx3|@SuicideStops I understand that
imdepressed_xx3|@SuicideStops I can't help but think of other people, and what they think of me. I'm a people pleaser.
imdepressed_xx3|@SuicideStops it doesn't seem so
imdepressed_xx3|I'm never enough
imdepressed_xx3|sometimes I wonder, did I mean anything to you?
imdepressed_xx3|I hate always being the first to start the conversation
imdepressed_xx3|I'm afraid if I cut, he won't want to talk to me anymore...
imdepressed_xx3|Sometimes, sorry doesn't help what you've done. Yet you will always be sorry
imdepressed_xx3|happy birthday to me☺️
imdepressed_xx3|"I wish he would text me back.
oh well"

imdepressed_xx3|friend zone strikes again
imdepressed_xx3|how can one person make you fall in love over and over again?

imdepressed_xx3|"I am a very unhappy person.
but I won't admit it to you
because I don't want you
to worry about me."
imdepressed_xx3|I feel like I'm slowly disappearing from his mind, not that I'm complaining. he probably doesn't want me there anyways.
imdepressed_xx3|my nightmares have been getting worse and worse.
imdepressed_xx3|I haven't been feeling well recently. at all.
imdepressed_xx3|life is way to short to live at war with yourself
imdepressed_xx3|I can't unlove you

I fall in love with you even more

imdepressed_xx3|on the twentieth I'll be 200 days clean 😊

imdepressed_xx3|I'm getting to that stage again in recovery when all you want to do is relapse but you don't want to let anyone down😒
imdepressed_xx3|I'm not really sure how I feel about being 186 days clean??
imdepressed_xx3|jealousy can sometimes get the best of me, but it's only because I care about you.
imdepressed_xx3|If I'm honest, death sounds so much better than life right now.
imdepressed_xx3|I'm scared of disappointing you.
imdepressed_xx3|36 days until my birthday :/
imdepressed_xx3|eyes are itching and I have no idea why
imdepressed_xx3|I hope you all know that if you need help or need someone to talk to know that I'm here for you 😊

imdepressed_xx3|same old bullshit but a different day
imdepressed_xx3|when you actually care, let me know...
imdepressed_xx3|not that he cares anyways so what's the point
imdepressed_xx3|If he doesn't reply to this message then I'm done 😔😒
imdepressed_xx3|I'm not going to try for someone who isn't trying for me anymore. I'm done with it 😒
imdepressed_xx3|and how nice would it be to fall asleep in the arms of someone whom loves you as much as you love them
imdepressed_xx3|what's the point of living when life is so unfair?
imdepressed_xx3|I start school again on Tuesday 😒
imdepressed_xx3|what's the point of me loving you, if you don't care anyways?
imdepressed_xx3|I'm still trying to figure out if it's worth it anymore
imdepressed_xx3|maybe life would be easier with out you. maybe it kills me that it might be
imdepressed_xx3|"I wouldn't mind dying,

imdepressed_xx3|everything seems to slip out of my grasp at one point.
imdepressed_xx3|I am not prepared for school to start up again..
imdepressed_xx3|I guess I can't vent anywhere now because everyone decides it's okay to invade my privacy so
imdepressed_xx3|so my best friend found this account😒

imdepressed_xx3|now for the long ride home...😌
imdepressed_xx3|god dammit

imdepressed_xx3|nights like these I would want to be in your arms.
imdepressed_xx3|I want you to be able to say I love you back.
imdepressed_xx3|Oh okay
imdepressed_xx3|I'm going to give up at one point. So tell me, do you need me? Do you love me?
imdepressed_xx3|when you say something about someone so much, they will start to believe it.

Time4Depression|🎶If you're happy and you know it, shut the fuck up🎶
Time4Depression|It will get worse. Just kidding...it's so incredibly awful already that it's actually impossible for it to get worse.
Time4Depression|Please recommend us to your friends. Oh wait, you have no friends.
Time4Depression|People that exercise a lot realize it's going to force them to live longer, right?
Time4Depression|Good things come to those who wait: death!
Time4Depression|I know it may seem like things are getting worse, but they're not… They've just always been this bad.
Time4Depression|Your youth is gone and it is never ever returning.
Time4Depression|On the plus side, your life is so devoid of happiness that something as stupid as an iWatch would actually make it better.
Time4Depression|Tweeting that should be depressing enough. RT “@Christoaster99: Can I get a depressing birthday tweet?”
Time4Depression|Rest up tonight, you have a long week of toiling in futility to look forward to.
Time4Depression|Each new week is a chance to reinvent yourself and fail in a whole new way!
Time4Depression|It's sad to have to go back to work tomorrow, but it's not like you did anything with your time off.
Time4Depression|Turn that frown upside down. You'll still be unhappy, but hopefully people will stop asking what's wrong.
Time4Depression|Success is just a matter of talent and will. You have neither.
Time4Depression|I know the constant disappointment of life is frustrating, but that's all there is, so just shut up and endure. #TGIF
Time4Depression|I'd say goodnight, but we both know it isn't.
Time4Depression|"Bad News: An asteroid will come perilously close to the Earth on Sunday.

Time4Depression|You know that little voice in your head that's always telling you you're not good enough? It's right. Also, you're probably schizophrenic.

Time4Depression|Fortunately, happiness was never even an option anyway.
Time4Depression|It's important to have high expectations for your life; they're what make it even more disappointing.
Time4Depression|Good morning! It's a beautiful day...to close the blinds and sit alone in a dark room.
Time4Depression|"Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
Everyone you've ever met will be dead some day."
Time4Depression|You may be home alone on a Friday night, but that only makes every week in a row.
Time4Depression|Tonight's the night when being alone hurts the most. Actually, tomorrow will be even worse.
Time4Depression|Feelings only create massive disappointment.
Time4Depression|Well, you made it to Friday. Now the only question is, what's the point?
Time4Depression|I don't need to go to sleep but I really want to stop crying.
Time4Depression|In each group of friends, there’s one person that everyone makes fun of. That person is you. Just kidding, you don’t have any friends.
Time4Depression|Tomorrow is a new day. It'll be shitty. Probably worse than today. But...wait, what was I saying?

Time4Depression|There is no secret formula for success...except, of course, being born someone else.
Time4Depression|Crying is usually the only exercise I get on a daily basis.
Time4Depression|Success and failure are the same thing when life is completely meaningless. It's easier to just not try.
Time4Depression|#ImHappyBecause there's a chance I could die in my sleep.
Time4Depression|If you ever feel like you have nothing in common with anyone, just remember that we all die.
Time4Depression|Yes, you have to go to work tomorrow, but that's no reason to be sad. Your miserable life, however... Now that's a reason to be sad.
Time4Depression|I know it seems like there are a bunch of people around, but trust me, you're alone.
Time4Depression|I wonder what I'll be watching on TV when I die alone.
Time4Depression|The advantage of not having any friends is that no one expects anything from you.
Time4Depression|It will get better...for everyone else...after you leave the party tonight.
Time4Depression|Having time to yourself is great until you realize that you're alone, like, completely alone.
Time4Depression|The crucial key to success is to not be you.
Time4Depression|Just go to bed. There's plenty more failure waiting for you tomorrow.
Time4Depression|Thinking about past failures can be pretty depressing. But thinking about all your failures in the future is even worse.
Time4Depression|Getting out of bed wouldn't be so hard if (your) life wasn't completely meaningless.
Time4Depression|Keep being a nobody - you're doing a great job!
Time4Depression|Spending time with people can be fun. Until that crushing sense of inadequacy forces you to accept how alone you truly are.
Time4Depression|Don't be too hard on yourself. No matter how much you try you will never amount to anything.
Time4Depression|Be grateful you’re all alone. You can cry all night without embarrassing yourself.
Time4Depression|Your parents don't care enough about you to be disappointed.
Time4Depression|Nothing in your life is ever going to change. Except the time between now and when you die.
Time4Depression|Keep trying to be someone else because the world will never respect anything you think or say.
Time4Depression|Big plans for the week? They will all amount to nothing.
Time4Depression|Even though there's people fatter than you, you're still fat. (Fatty.)
Time4Depression|Saturday night is a good time to do nothing and spend time alone. Just like every other night of your life.
Time4Depression|Don't worry about wasted time. You're a complete waste of time.
Time4Depression|The more you try, the more you realize how untalented you are.
Time4Depression|Each day is an opportunity to improve your life which you completely ignore.
Time4Depression|There are two types of people in this world: you and everyone else.  They will always be better than you.
Time4Depression|Buying natural, healthy food will not change what a horrible person you are.

Time4Depression|No matter what you tell yourself, nothing you buy will ever make you feel better better. Except for ice cream...that shit is delicious.
Time4Depression|I love sunsets. They mean the day is over and I am now that much closer to death. They're also pretty.
Time4Depression|They found Waldo. He's dead.
Time4Depression|When the going gets tough, the tough are crushed under the same existential dread as everyone else and eventually die poor &amp; unfulfilled.
Time4Depression|Birth &gt;&gt; Futility of Existence &gt;&gt; Death
Time4Depression|Make love not war. Unfortunately, you don't have the capacity to do either.
Time4Depression|It will (never) get better.
Time4Depression|"Good News: You live in the age of the greatest connectivity humanity has ever seen.

Bad News: You're using it to read this."
Time4Depression|Effort is just not worth the effort.
Time4Depression|Fortunately, your time is worth so little, it's literally impossible for you to waste it.
Time4Depression|"Plans for the Weekend
1. Misery
2. Regret
3. Be alone
4. Order from Home Shopping Network just for the human contact.
5. Maybe go bowling."
Time4Depression|That gnawing sense of dread inside will eventually go away...when you die.
Time4Depression|TGIF! Thousands of people will die of natural causes this weekend.
Time4Depression|Why waste energy trying when you can just quit and take a nap?
Time4Depression|"Live each day to the fullest!
Or don't.
Honestly, it just doesn't matter.
Nothing does.
Have a great day!"
Time4Depression|Tomorrow is a new day! Put the pain of your miserable life behind you and start an all new miserable life!
Time4Depression|You know, other than being totally and completely alone in the world, I really don't have all that much going for me.
Time4Depression|Spoiler Alert: It only gets worse.
Time4Depression|TIMELINE OF LIFE:  birth &gt;&gt; things you regret doing/not doing &gt;&gt; death
Time4Depression|I know things seem bad now, but they could be a lot worse. I have no idea how, but it seems plausible, I guess.
Time4Depression|If at first you don't succeed, try try again. Or just quit. I'm sure Taco Bell is hiring.
Time4Depression|Sometimes, I wonder what the point of all of this is. Then, I remember that there is no point and I just go back to bed. #blessed
Time4Depression|If time is indeed non-linear, then we are already dead. #SundayFunday
Time4Depression|We all die alone. #WorldCup2014
Time4Depression|Looks like I have another day of not being dead.
Time4Depression|Having fun tonight? Yeah, I didn't think so.
Time4Depression|It's the weekend, so you have a choice: You can either stay in and be all alone or go and, well, still be all alone.
Time4Depression|A little something to help with your plans tonight... http://t.co/LU0oOgMiIm

Time4Depression|Dying alone and a calculator are just about all you can count on.
Time4Depression|If you think these tweets are depressing, just imagine having to come up with this shit.
Time4Depression|At any moment a sinkhole could up open and swallow you whole, so at least there's one thing to look forward to.
Time4Depression|Try to think of each new day as an opportunity. An opportunity to fail.
Time4Depression|I try to stay positive at the end of the day and remind myself that I might die in my sleep.
Time4Depression|All good things must come to an end. Not that anything good ever happens.
Time4Depression|Each day is a chance to throw off the shackles that've been holding you back and choose to succeed. Or just give up. You should give up.
Time4Depression|The fact that you're reading this right now should be depressing enough.
Time4Depression|If at first you don't succeed, try try to forget your miserable failure and keep living your pointless life.
Time4Depression|Even if they were listening, it's not like I have anything interesting to say.
Time4Depression|The best part of waking up is going back to bed.
Time4Depression|You only live once...which is still too much. #SundayFunday
Time4Depression|Happy people are just too dumb to know better.
Time4Depression|First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes crushing debt, then your kids abandon you in a nursing home and you die alone.
Time4Depression|If you think things are bad now, just wait until they never get better.
Time4Depression|Eventually, things will change. Probably for the worse, but at least it'll be something different.
Time4Depression|Who needs friends when you can just be painfully lonely all the time?
Time4Depression|You know that deep emptiness that hangs over you like an unending cloud of misery? That will be the best part of your day.
Time4Depression|We will all be dead someday. #TGIF
Time4Depression|Life is pointless, so you might as well waste it doing what you love: Being totally and completely alone in the world.
Time4Depression|World Cup Update: You will die alone. #WorldCup
Time4Depression|Have a nice day! You won't, but pretending is as close as you'll ever get.
Time4Depression|You're alone now, so dying alone should be a pretty easy transition.
Time4Depression|Just kidding...you have no friends.
Time4Depression|In every group of friends, there's one person that the others talk shit about behind their back. If you don't know who that is, it's you.
Time4Depression|That hot mugshot felon is now more famous &amp; successful than you could ever possibly be.
Time4Depression|Potential is a relative concept, but whatever yours is, you'll never reach it.
Time4Depression|Spoiler Alert: It never gets better.
Time4Depression|Life is completely and totally hopeless. Goodnight!
Time4Depression|You can't fail if you don't try.
Time4Depression|Don't worry, disappointment and regret are always just around the corner!
Time4Depression|Shut off your computer and go live your life...alone...because nobody loves you.
Time4Depression|The more I learn about how deadly cigarettes are, the more I want to start smoking.

Time4Depression|You could either die in your sleep tonight, or have to get up and go to work tomorrow. You lose either way.
Time4Depression|Death is life's only certainty. #SundayFunday
Time4Depression|When the going gets tough, just quit. Life is meaningless, so why bother trying?
Time4Depression|Don't worry, I'm sure nothing will ever get any better.
Time4Depression|"Good News: It's Friday!

Bad News: You have nothing to do and no one to do it with. #TGIF"
Time4Depression|"Bad News: An Ebola outbreak in Africa is out of control.

Good News: It could kill us all."
Time4Depression|You've almost made it to the weekend, where you'll have plenty of time to reflect on everything you did wrong this week.
Time4Depression|#Undateable is trending. You're famous!
Time4Depression|My only hope is that I get to die before I'm old and decrepit enough to want to die.
Time4Depression|Whenever you're feeling fat, ugly or unsuccessful, just remember that one day you'll be dead.
Time4Depression|You were doomed from birth. #throwbackthursday

3. Crawl inside."
Time4Depression|You're in a dead end job, in a dead end life, in a country on the decline. Goodnight!

Time4Depression|The good news is, when a life is as shitty as yours, literally ANY change is an improvement.
Time4Depression|In every group of friends, there's always one person that gets made fun of by everyone else. If you had any friends, that would be you.
Time4Depression|Don't worry, I'm sure there are plenty of other losers sitting at home on Twitter tonight.

Time4Depression|The moment you reach sexual maturity, your body begins dying, which makes sense because your sex life has always been dead, anyway.
Time4Depression|As bad as things seem now, just know that they will get worse. So much fucking worse.
Time4Depression|You have no self-esteem, which turned out to be the perfect amount.
Time4Depression|The glass isn’t half full, it’s totally full. Of failure. Your failure.
Time4Depression|You're not full of shit, but only because your massive body fat percentage leaves no extra room.
Time4Depression|You may as well get up and go to work tomorrow, it's not like you have anything better to do with your life.

Time4Depression|Finally, Target has created an aisle just for you. (photo from @andyheriaud) http://t.co/vgXtuDCnq0
Time4Depression|Some light reading. http://t.co/jYw2KEugrk
Time4Depression|Even food is unhappy to see you. http://t.co/dx0E3wjC8v
Time4Depression|You are... http://t.co/Wk06dhhJyE
Time4Depression|Happy Graduation! http://t.co/IeIE46p3Iq
Time4Depression|Yeah, and now it's OVER. RT @sarahz727 hey Depressing Thoughts I actually had a fun day
Time4Depression|You’re not the first person to be a failure, but you certainly are the best at it.
Time4Depression|Sure, other people are out having fun tonight, but those people have friends.
Time4Depression|They didn't miss your call, they're ignoring it.
Time4Depression|Never has anyone done so little with so little.
Time4Depression|"Nobody…

…thinks about you when you’re not around

…is listening when you talk

…knows who you are

…wants you around

…loves you
   
…cares"
Time4Depression|You make failure look like an art form...a really shitty art form.
Time4Depression|"Give up.
Give in.
Go to bed."
Time4Depression|"Good News: Maybe you'll dream that you're someone else tonight.
Bad News: You're not."
Time4Depression|Look to drugs for your happiness.
Time4Depression|It's often said that there is someone out there for everyone. You will never meet them.
Time4Depression|Life's slipping out of your control &amp; there's nothing you can do to stop it. And you're fat. And you have no friends. And nobody loves you.
Time4Depression|Jesus is dead, Jeff. RT @jeffnorman90 Not even Jesus?
Time4Depression|I don't know if you've noticed, but nobody loves you.
Time4Depression|Life is a constant, painful struggle but the reward is that you get to die unfulfilled and alone.
Time4Depression|Take your age and double it. Divide that by 10 and add 12, then go sit in a corner and cry because your whole life is a waste.
Time4Depression|Roses are red, violets are blue, you will die alone.
Time4Depression|I know it feels like the odds are stacked against you, but they are. They definitely are.
Time4Depression|If you were to die, it could be months before anyone noticed you were gone. Just kidding, nobody would ever notice you were gone.
Time4Depression|Try not to think of Monday as the start of the workweek, but as the end of your freedom.
Time4Depression|You did absolutely nothing today, which is far more than anyone ever expects of you.
Time4Depression|Everything you do to try to improve your life will fail. Happy Sunday!
Time4Depression|Nobody has ever been as alone as you are right now.
Time4Depression|"You

are

all

alone

in

the 

world."
Time4Depression|Your friends aren't avoiding you, they just aren't your friends.
Time4Depression|Whether you try or not, you will still have the same result: FAILURE
Time4Depression|"You know when people say, ""I love you""?  They're talking to someone else."
Time4Depression|The world is filled with countless opportunities...for you to fail.
Time4Depression|It will get worse, much worse. But then again, so will you!
Time4Depression|Just go to bed and maybe things will be better tomorrow. They won't be, but there's always a chance you'll die in your sleep.
Time4Depression|try - fail - repeat until death
Time4Depression|Have you given up yet? You should.
Time4Depression|If it wasn’t for being hopelessly alone, you wouldn’t be anything at all.
Time4Depression|It turns out, money really does buy happiness, which makes sense because you have neither.
Time4Depression|You're not going to bed, you're giving up.
Time4Depression|Resistance is futile, just like your pathetic little life.
Time4Depression|Misery loves company and that company appears to be Walmart.
Time4Depression|It's not a matter of IF you'll fail, it's a matter of WHEN.
Time4Depression|Maybe you won't wake up tomorrow. Wait, that would be good news, wouldn't it?
Time4Depression|Your parents don't actually love you. #ConfessionNight
Time4Depression|It's a whole new week...for you to fail just the same.
Time4Depression|The week's about to start. Have you come up with a lie to tell everyone about your weekend, so they don't know what a fucking loser you are?
Time4Depression|Happy Sunday. Or, as you know it: just another day filled with absolute misery.
Time4Depression|Sure, you're all alone on a Saturday night, but you're probably used to that.
Time4Depression|Why aren't you out with your friends today? Oh yeah, you don't have any.
Time4Depression|It will get worse. Much worse.
Time4Depression|What are you up to tonight? I mean, other than being alone.
Time4Depression|You may feel lonely right now, but IT WILL NEVER END.
Time4Depression|"Weekend Checklist:
1.) Nothing. You have no plans.
2.) See above
3.) See above
4.) See above
5.) See above
6.) See above
7.) See above"
Time4Depression|The sun is shining and it's a whole new day...filled with failure!
Time4Depression|Just think, when you wake up tomorrow, everything will still suck!
Time4Depression|Having a bad day? I'm not surprised, you do have a pretty shitty life.
Time4Depression|Love is in the air. Wait, no, that's Bird Flu. Oh well, you were going to die alone anyway.
Time4Depression|Go ahead and turn off your alarm. Nobody will miss you if you don't show up tomorrow.
Time4Depression|It couldn’t possibly get worse, but it will anyway.
Time4Depression|Even your imaginary friends hate you. Just kidding, they don’t even know you exist.
Time4Depression|Good night, Twitter. If you need any depressing thoughts, go look in the mirror.

Time4Depression|Reach for the stars. You'll fail at anything you try, so you might as well do it spectacularly!
Time4Depression|All good things must come to an end, which means you may be immortal.
Time4Depression|When the going gets tough, you quit.
Time4Depression|Celebrate the new week by failing horribly. You're already doing that? Then I guess you're all set!
Time4Depression|You will die alone. #HonestHour
Time4Depression|You will either die in your sleep or have to get up and go to work tomorrow.
Time4Depression|You're all alone, but that's fine because everyone hates you. #SundayFunday
Time4Depression|When you masturbate, the ghosts of your dead relatives watch. Goodnight!
Time4Depression|"Last Saturday: Alone

This Saturday: Alone

Next Saturday: Alone"
Time4Depression|Spring is here. Love is in the air. You will die alone.
Time4Depression|Don't you have anything better to do than sit around on a Friday night reading this? Oh yeah, you don't.
Time4Depression|UPDATE: You're fat.
Time4Depression|It's a crazy, unpredictable world, but at least you can always depend on failure.
Time4Depression|These bombers have already gotten more coverage and attention than all their victims combined.
Time4Depression|It's not low self-esteem, it's good judgement.
Time4Depression|Someone you went to high school with is now selling their asshole for drugs. So, basically, everyone is having sex but you.
Time4Depression|Trying hasn't worked, so maybe you should just give up.
Time4Depression|On the bright side, everyone expects you to be terrible, so it's not like you're disappointing anyone.

Time4Depression|#MentionSomeoneWhoHasAPrettyFace NOT YOU
Time4Depression|It's time to give up. Actually, it was time a while ago and you've just been making a fool of yourself these past few months.
Time4Depression|"You will die...

alone"
Time4Depression|You may only be dead on the inside, but you smell like you’re dead on the outside too.

Time4Depression|#LetsTalkAboutSex: NOBODY wants to have it with you.
Time4Depression|The depressing thoughts are pretty well taken care of for today.
Time4Depression|Happy Monday! Your inevitable death is now one day closer!
Time4Depression|"There's light at the end of the tunnel. :)

It's a train. :("
Time4Depression|It's a beautiful day. You should probably stay in, so you don't ruin it for everyone else. Also, you're fat and you will die alone.
Time4Depression|You don't just feel lonely, you're alone. All alone. SO. FUCKING. ALONE.

Time4Depression|You tried. You failed. Of course.
Time4Depression|What are you up to tonight? You know, other than being totally alone in the world.
Time4Depression|It's not whether you win or lose, it's how much of a fucking loser you are.
Time4Depression|You're fat. #NationalGrilledCheeseDay
Time4Depression|Go ahead and take a break. A long one. Really long. In fact, don’t come back.
Time4Depression|If it seems too good to be true, it must not apply to you.
Time4Depression|Life is not hopeless, but you are.

Time4Depression|I know it feels pointless to keep trying, but it definitely is.
Time4Depression|There is no heaven and there is no hell. When you die, you simply disappear. So, it's pretty similar to how your life is already.
Time4Depression|Maybe drugs and alcohol will help.

Time4Depression|It may seem like you're all alone tonight, but you're far too fat to ever really be alone.
Time4Depression|Everyone you care about is out having the time of their lives tonight. Also, they don't care about you.
Time4Depression|You could go hang out with your friends tonight, but that would mean finding some and that's impossible.
Time4Depression|It's Friday! Nobody loves you.
Time4Depression|There’s no “I” in team or “friends” in your life.
Time4Depression|Win or lose, you still suck.
Time4Depression|You didn't die in your sleep, so I guess it's another day of punishment and misery...
Time4Depression|You might not wake up tomorrow. Good night!!
Time4Depression|First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes crushing debt, then your kids abandon you in a nursing home and you die alone.
Time4Depression|Everyone that loves you will die someday. Just kidding, nobody loves you.
Time4Depression|When life knocks you down, stay down. Why endure more punishment?
Time4Depression|You're not surrounded by strong capable people, they're surrounded by you. You’re THAT FAT.
Time4Depression|Your friends would try to avoid you, but you don't have any.
Time4Depression|Successful people know business, finance, or medicine. You know every episode of The Big Bang Theory.
Time4Depression|If you think you're depressed about your weight, think about how your couch cushions must feel.

AnxietyOFC|You've been on my mind lately.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/ps3R4Zt4j6
AnxietyOFC|I need you when the time that she needs you.
AnxietyOFC|I miss you but I’m trying not to care. I love you, but I’m trying not to show. I want you, but what can I do when you are not even mine?
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes I wish that I could have said I love you one more time before you left from my life. I really miss you!
AnxietyOFC|I wish you missed me like I miss you.
AnxietyOFC|When I close my eyes, I see you. When I open my eyes, I miss you.
AnxietyOFC|I wish you were here to tell me that everything is gonna be okay.
AnxietyOFC|In French, you don’t really say “I miss you”, you say “Tu me manques” which means “You are missing from me.”
AnxietyOFC|Your time is way too valuable to be wasting on people that can’t accept who you are.
AnxietyOFC|Thank God I found the GOOD in goodbye.
AnxietyOFC|Pain will leave you, when you let go.
AnxietyOFC|If you want to fly on the sky, you need to leave the earth. If you want to move forward, you need to let go the past that drags you down.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes holding on does more damage than letting go.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes people come into your life just to teach you how to let go.
AnxietyOFC|Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow.
AnxietyOFC|If they keep hurting you, love them and stay or love yourself and leave.
AnxietyOFC|A woman who opens her heart to love you, when its already broken, is braver than any person you’ll meet.
AnxietyOFC|I know my heart will never be the same but I’m telling myself I’ll be okay.
AnxietyOFC|Don’t be sorry. I trusted you, my fault. Not yours.
AnxietyOFC|Heaven doesn’t ignore cries of a broken heart.

AnxietyOFC|Past can’t hurt you unless you let it.
AnxietyOFC|The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do.
AnxietyOFC|My shyness has ruined so many opportunities.
AnxietyOFC|Awesome feeling when someone is making an effort to make you smile.
AnxietyOFC|It’s hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember.
AnxietyOFC|The best love is the one that makes you a better person. Without changing you into someone other than yourself.
AnxietyOFC|Some people are real, some people are good, some people are fake and some people are real good at being fake.
AnxietyOFC|Relationships are much harder now because conversations become texting, arguments become phone calls, and feelings become facebook statuses.
AnxietyOFC|I knew I was in love when all those stupid love songs started making sense.
AnxietyOFC|Slow replies make me think you are talking to someone better than me.
AnxietyOFC|Being single is so much better than being cheating on, lied to, and disrespected.
AnxietyOFC|Just because the relationship ended doesn’t mean the feelings did.
AnxietyOFC|You can’t have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time.
AnxietyOFC|Obstacles can’t stop you, problems can’t stop you, most of all, other people can’t stop you. The only one who stops you is yourself.
AnxietyOFC|It’s hard asking someone with a broken heart to fall in love again.
AnxietyOFC|Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can’t help them, atleast don’t hurt them.
AnxietyOFC|Single and in a relationship are just titles. Your heart determines your true relationship status.
AnxietyOFC|It hurts to breathe because every breath I take proves I can’t live without you.
AnxietyOFC|Memory is a way of holding onto the things you love, the things you never want to lose ever.
AnxietyOFC|Hearts can break. Yes, hearts can break. Sometimes I think it would be better if we died when they did, but we don’t.
AnxietyOFC|God can heal a broken heart, but He has to have all the pieces.
AnxietyOFC|The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of valuing someone too much.

AnxietyOFC|Never frown even when you’re sad ’cause you never know when someone’s falling in love with your smile.
AnxietyOFC|Yes! I'm a girl. And I'm not interested with make up.
AnxietyOFC|One of the hardest decision you'll ever face in life is choosing whether to walk away or try much harder.
AnxietyOFC|The person who really loves you will never make you feel unloved.
AnxietyOFC|Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because his new girlfriend looks like a horse.
AnxietyOFC|Get a man who is mature enough to handle your relationship, not a man who breaks up with you just because he is tired of you.
AnxietyOFC|Suicide is not the answer to your problems.
AnxietyOFC|I thought you were my friend, but you only used me as a handkerchief, then left behind.
AnxietyOFC|We might think that we are always right, but God knows our real intentions.
AnxietyOFC|You are my 12 am thoughts and my 11:11 wish.

AnxietyOFC|If you really care about someone, you'll make time for them.
AnxietyOFC|I said I was fine, but I never said it didn't hurt.
AnxietyOFC|I wish you were sensitive enough.
AnxietyOFC|Once you start loving someone it's hard to stop.
AnxietyOFC|You don't need to compare me with others, I know my imperfections.
AnxietyOFC|A million words would not bring you back, I know because I tried, neither would a million tears, I know because I cried.
AnxietyOFC|I hate to see the one I love happy with somebody, but I surely hate it more to see the one I love unhappy with me.
AnxietyOFC|Some of us think holding on makes us strong; but sometimes it is letting go.
AnxietyOFC|Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/e14fAfAGbs
AnxietyOFC|Dying seems less sad than having lived too little.
AnxietyOFC|The walls we build around us to keep out the sadness also keep out the joy.
AnxietyOFC|Why am I always missing you, when you're not missing me?
AnxietyOFC|Now I'm missing our old long conversations, our old sweet smiles, and our old burdened promises. I miss the old us.
AnxietyOFC|The stronger we fight. The longer relationship we'll have.
AnxietyOFC|I will stay stronger than I could because this is the right thing to do.
AnxietyOFC|From what we are and we were, it's hidden in the scars.
AnxietyOFC|Heartaches and heartbreaks. No worries I used to it.
AnxietyOFC|I love my scars because they stayed with me longer than most people have.
AnxietyOFC|hey you! yes you, you'll be okay someday.
AnxietyOFC|Too soon for our conversation to end.
AnxietyOFC|It is up to your choice. You stay or you leave, I will accept.
AnxietyOFC|I think I'm better dead.
AnxietyOFC|I already found my happiness. Why leave you if it's gonna be sadness to lose you.
AnxietyOFC|I miss the old us. Everything has changed.
AnxietyOFC|Do what you want but promise you will never leave.
AnxietyOFC|When I say I loved you, I really do.
AnxietyOFC|I love the way you tell me those eight letters.
AnxietyOFC|I stayed because you want me to.
AnxietyOFC|I will stay just for you.
AnxietyOFC|I want to thanked you from not leaving.

AnxietyOFC|I can't imagine how empty and how colorless the world could be, until I tried to live it without you.
AnxietyOFC|I hate being in the mood where nothing's really wrong, but nothing feels right either.
AnxietyOFC|"Biggest lie ever:
""I'll never leave you I promise""."
AnxietyOFC|That awkward moment when you're that one friend who always gives relationship advice, but is still single.
AnxietyOFC|Mistake, a really big mistake. Telling your crush name to your bestfriend.
AnxietyOFC|I wish I had a perfect photo with you.
AnxietyOFC|If you're single, make the best of it. It's not because you're not good enough for anyone, but it  means no one is good enough for you yet.
AnxietyOFC|Never make the one you love feel alone, especially when you're right there.
AnxietyOFC|If loving her means you'll protect her in every way a woman can be protected, then it's fine with me.
AnxietyOFC|When you love, DON'T EXPECT, DON'T ASSUME, because it will only leave you hurting in the end.
AnxietyOFC|"I might hug and laugh with other guys. 
Talk with them. 
But none of them will ever mean as much to me as you do."
AnxietyOFC|You will realize my importance in your life. Once you left me.
AnxietyOFC|Someday you will miss me. But that day I will forget you.
AnxietyOFC|It so sad to think the ones who self harm, are the most gentle that would rather hurt themselves than anyone else.
AnxietyOFC|Stop thinking about everything so much, you're breaking your own heart.

AnxietyOFC|"If you're single:
1. You're either talking to someone.

AnxietyOFC|I care for you. I hope you know.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/ewtrpmEXcQ
AnxietyOFC|I feel like you have been taken away.
AnxietyOFC|Dear brother and sister, you should feel proud to have such a cute and sweet sister like me.
AnxietyOFC|Hey you! Yes you, he is active but not for you.
AnxietyOFC|Ignore me twice, and you won't be able to receive a message from me.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/exq5gSdf7g
AnxietyOFC|I get attracted by the looks but I fell in love by the character and attitude.
AnxietyOFC|I can't stop wanting you.
AnxietyOFC|My first thought in the morning is always you.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes it takes a heartbreak to shake us awake and help us see we are worth so much more than we’re settling for.
AnxietyOFC|A broken heart is just the growing pains necessary so that you can love more completely when the real thing comes along.
AnxietyOFC|So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.
AnxietyOFC|God, thank you for making me strong, thank you for everything.
AnxietyOFC|Promise me you'll never forget me because if I thought you would, I'd never leave.
AnxietyOFC|You know why it hurts? because it's real. Come to think of it, have you ever been hurt in your dream?
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes the person you fall for isn't ready to catch you.
AnxietyOFC|Some people will notice the change in your attitude towards them, but won't notice their own behavior that made you change.
AnxietyOFC|I don’t care if we on good terms or not, the secrets and insecurities you shared with me would never leave my mouth.
AnxietyOFC|No matter how strong a girl is, she always has a breaking point.
AnxietyOFC|People will talk no matter what, do your own thing and don't stress over it.
AnxietyOFC|I'm not always happy, I mean there are days that I just need to shut down and take a break.
AnxietyOFC|Talk to God before you sleep.

AnxietyOFC|The best feeling in the world is being loved back by the person you love.
AnxietyOFC|I'm tired and confused. I want to sleep forever.
AnxietyOFC|All your flaws and I still think you are perfect.
AnxietyOFC|"There's no need to rush.
If something is meant to be.
It will happen in the right time, with the right person for the best person."
AnxietyOFC|"They said ""When someone loves you, they don't have to say it, but you can tell it by the way they treat you."""
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes the wrong choices lead us to the right places.

AnxietyOFC|Sometimes you try not to care no matter how much they do, because sometimes you mean nothing to someone who means everything to you.
AnxietyOFC|Relationship gets stronger when both of you are willing to understand and forgive each other's mistakes.
AnxietyOFC|I never hate you for not loving me anymore, but I hate myself for still loving you.
AnxietyOFC|"There will be haters. 
There will be doubters.
There will be non-believers.
But, there will be you proving them wrong."
AnxietyOFC|Instead of idolizing seth and bashing his girlfriend, why don't you focus on your priorities?
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes to be hurt is enjoyable than to pretend.
AnxietyOFC|I miss your hugs.
AnxietyOFC|I will stay no matter how hard the situation is.
AnxietyOFC|Psychologist says: The more loyal you are, the more disappointment you encounter and experience.

AnxietyOFC|It's hard to beat a person who never gives up. Choose to be that person today.
AnxietyOFC|Can I just sleep and ignore the world?
AnxietyOFC|The deepest pain I’ve ever felt was denying my own feelings to make everyone else comfortable.
AnxietyOFC|Undo your priority list and write my name first.
AnxietyOFC|It’s gonna hurt me to hate you, but loving you is worse.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/tZN3xA0y1g
AnxietyOFC|"Instead of asking ""Do you love me?"" ask him ""How long would your love last?"""
AnxietyOFC|There are a lot of boys/girls out there. And yet I fell in love with someone who doesn't love me back. Why?
AnxietyOFC|Be with her for a reason, and let her be the reason for you to stay.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/dHQgjn0Guz
AnxietyOFC|Just be your self don't let other people change you.
AnxietyOFC|People cry not because love ends. They cry because love still continues even it's over.
AnxietyOFC|"Them: God, Help me end my life.
Me: God, Help me save mine."
AnxietyOFC|You never knew how much I tried to be with you.
AnxietyOFC|She's a sad song with a smiling face. Take time to listen and you'll find out why.
AnxietyOFC|I really wish we could be the same as we were before.
AnxietyOFC|"Stuck between ""I don't wanna feel that type of hurt again"" but ""I wanna feel that type of love again"""
AnxietyOFC|Have you ever thought of me as a great friend? I think you have not.
AnxietyOFC|I'm much more me when I'm with you, it is comfortable to speak myself out.
AnxietyOFC|Some boys tend to cheat. Why is that?

AnxietyOFC|I don't want to get hurt, again.
AnxietyOFC|We all hate to be compared to other people.
AnxietyOFC|Fake people don’t surprise me anymore, loyal people do.
AnxietyOFC|I want to restart my life and make things right.
AnxietyOFC|It doesn't mean that I didn't talk to you, I didn't miss you.
AnxietyOFC|I know my jokes are corny but atleast I tried to make you laugh.
AnxietyOFC|I'll give you all.
AnxietyOFC|I hate acting like I don't care when it's really tearing me up inside.
AnxietyOFC|It's hard asking someone with a broken heart to fall in love again.
AnxietyOFC|Don’t say that she deserves someone better, be the person that she deserves.
AnxietyOFC|I won't give up.
AnxietyOFC|How to forget?
AnxietyOFC|I feel my body giving up.
AnxietyOFC|Staring at my message hoping that you'll reply.
AnxietyOFC|How can I give advices to those people who wants to commit suicide?
AnxietyOFC|Don't love someone who's in love with another person. You already know the consequences.
AnxietyOFC|How to love?
AnxietyOFC|Is it too hard to be happy?!
AnxietyOFC|I can smile, but deep inside? I’m drowning.
AnxietyOFC|It kills me indside, swear!
AnxietyOFC|Some girls think they are not attractive because they don't look like the girls that get worshipped on social media and that's unfortunate.

AnxietyOFC|Move on? Don't worry I've been there.
AnxietyOFC|"Note to everyone:
Do not leave your important valuable things unattended, you might lost them and you'll never find it anymore."
AnxietyOFC|You're older than me, yet you act so damn immature!
AnxietyOFC|I still remember when we started talking, I trusted you with things I would have never trusted anyone else with, and then you left.
AnxietyOFC|Why am I doing this? I want him to become my motivation, but it looks like I'm losing my interest in everything.
AnxietyOFC|You blocked me? Then okay, it's your choice. Just forget every single details about me and forget our past, thank you!
AnxietyOFC|This person isn't available right now.
AnxietyOFC|He's not perfect, but I do love him.
AnxietyOFC|"I wanna wrap you up. 
I wanna kiss your lips. 
I wanna make you feel wanted. 
I wanna call you mine. 
I wanna hold you forever."
AnxietyOFC|You have no idea how much I miss you right now.
AnxietyOFC|Treat her right, if you don’t want a fight.
AnxietyOFC|Once you fall inlove, prepare to fall apart.
AnxietyOFC|I love you but you do love her.
AnxietyOFC|I feel empty.
AnxietyOFC|What makes you sad?
AnxietyOFC|I feel incomplete.
AnxietyOFC|We have both shared the laughter and the pain.
AnxietyOFC|I will love you and honor you all the days of my life.
AnxietyOFC|Tired.
AnxietyOFC|You'll be back again.
AnxietyOFC|I'm lost and foolish.
AnxietyOFC|I'm always at your back.
AnxietyOFC|The would heals but that scar remains.
AnxietyOFC|Nothing is predictable when it comes to love.
AnxietyOFC|I'm always behind of you.
AnxietyOFC|I'm hoping you'll end up with me.
AnxietyOFC|This is what we are.

AnxietyOFC|If you love someone, don't lie, open up. Be honest, no secrets.
AnxietyOFC|Having many girlfriends does not make you a man. It only makes you a womanizer and a cheater boy.
AnxietyOFC|I love you, in case we stop talking.
AnxietyOFC|Failure is not a mistake. Sometimes it is the best way to start.
AnxietyOFC|Pain changes people. It makes them trust less. Over think more and shut people out.
AnxietyOFC|She's the type of girl, you'll regret lossing.
AnxietyOFC|I'll be fine, I will be.
AnxietyOFC|I'm not crying because of you you're not worth it. I'm crying because my delusion of who you were was shattered by the truth of who you are.
AnxietyOFC|The saddest people try their best to make people happy. They know what it's like to feel worthless . They don't want anyone to feel that.
AnxietyOFC|Love is hard to find, hard to keep, and hard to forget.
AnxietyOFC|I’m a strong person. But do you know what makes me cry? It's when I gave my best but I still feel useless.
AnxietyOFC|I wish I was enough for someone.
AnxietyOFC|You won't understand because you're not me.
AnxietyOFC|I hate getting flashbacks from things I don't want to remember.
AnxietyOFC|Why do we only realize things when it's too late.
AnxietyOFC|The saddest people try their best to make people happy. They know what it's like to feel worthless. They don't want anyone to feel that.
AnxietyOFC|Having anxiety is the most silently painful experience. It makes no sense and you sit there alone and suffer for a reason unknown.
AnxietyOFC|The worse type of sadness is when you have no explanation for it.
AnxietyOFC|Sleep doesn't help. If it's your soul that's tired.
AnxietyOFC|How I wish you could see things from my point of view.
AnxietyOFC|My biggest fear is putting my whole heart and effort into a someone and not knowing whether they will stay or leave me.

AnxietyOFC|You don't deserve my precious tears.
AnxietyOFC|You are beautiful. You don't need to beg for their attention.
AnxietyOFC|Classic filipino serenade will never go out of style, so as hand written love letters.
AnxietyOFC|A day without God is like a mind with no thoughts, empty. Thank God for this blessing we call life.
AnxietyOFC|"Every students weaknesses

Recitation."
AnxietyOFC|Happiness begins with you. Not with your relationship, your friends, or your job. But with you.
AnxietyOFC|How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
AnxietyOFC|I wish I could sleep without having to sleep on dreaded bed.
AnxietyOFC|The promises of God has no expiration date.
AnxietyOFC|I was sick of saying sorry, so I said goodbye.
AnxietyOFC|Losing you is like losing my interest in everything.
AnxietyOFC|Stop crying no one will comfort you.
AnxietyOFC|I want to greet you 'good morning' but I know it will just ruin your mood.
AnxietyOFC|Thank you for teaching me how to love.
AnxietyOFC|I'm tired of being tired.
AnxietyOFC|Watching you while watching her is my routine.
AnxietyOFC|Good morning. Start your day with Jesus. God bless you.
AnxietyOFC|I need someone to talk.
AnxietyOFC|"Me: If I die?
Someone important to me: No one's care.
Me: Yeah, that's right thanks."
AnxietyOFC|Silent crying while thinking if I'm still important.
AnxietyOFC|Failure is not an option. It's a step.
AnxietyOFC|You're my source of happiness. Please, don't leave.
AnxietyOFC|Maybe I need to delete my messenger, because it looks like they don't want to talk to me as well as they don't remember someone like me.
AnxietyOFC|You'll never be forgotten. I miss you!
AnxietyOFC|I'm about to give up. I'm so tired of this damn life.
AnxietyOFC|I guess its the end of our story.
AnxietyOFC|Don't ignore someones' comment in your posts. You don't know what they feel everytime you do that.
AnxietyOFC|The saddest part is every time I leave, you just let me go.
AnxietyOFC|You'll always have a place in my heart.
AnxietyOFC|Just tell me where it hurts.
AnxietyOFC|I'm gonna miss you.
AnxietyOFC|I say I'm fine but I'm all broke on the inside.
AnxietyOFC|I miss the old us so much.
AnxietyOFC|Having crush on someone who will never like me back isn't my thing anymore.
AnxietyOFC|Seeing your 'goodnight' message will end up myself smiling until morning.
AnxietyOFC|Can we go back to the times when everything are still fine?
AnxietyOFC|Why is it hard for you to understand that I love you so much?
AnxietyOFC|Your 'goodnight' message will do.
AnxietyOFC|Despite all the struggles, I think it was necessary to make me who I am today.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes life's greatest gift is the ones the least we expect.
AnxietyOFC|Waiting to your reply.
AnxietyOFC|Goodnight. Talk to God before you sleep.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/007cHE7lLd
AnxietyOFC|Remembering you is easy, I do it everyday. But missing you is a heartache that never goes away.
AnxietyOFC|I don't need your opinion. So shut up your damn mouth.
AnxietyOFC|No matter what I do, all I think is about you.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes I don't wanna exist, but I don't wanna die and I'm not suicidal I just want not to exist.
AnxietyOFC|Your smile is priceless.
AnxietyOFC|If I died today, would you love me tomorrow?
AnxietyOFC|I want your warm hug.
AnxietyOFC|I need a break from everything.
AnxietyOFC|Tired of all heartbreaks and heartaches.
AnxietyOFC|I can notice when the person I'm talking to is bored.
AnxietyOFC|I hate being compared.
AnxietyOFC|Why do I still missing you?
AnxietyOFC|They told me that to make him fall in love, I had to make him laugh. But everytime he laughs, I'm the one who falls in love.
AnxietyOFC|You are the reason why I look so much happier than I ever was.
AnxietyOFC|So sick of being cute.
AnxietyOFC|Can't do anything because I need to accept what happened to you.
AnxietyOFC|Being with you is my favorite happiness.

AnxietyOFC|The heart was made to be broken.
AnxietyOFC|The saddest thing about love is that not only that it cannot last forever, but that heartbreak is soon forgotten.
AnxietyOFC|I miss you so much I can't even describe it.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes all you need, is someone who can make you smile.
AnxietyOFC|Never regret yesterday. Life is in you today, and you make your tomorrow.
AnxietyOFC|It hurts when person you can't forget, forgets you.
AnxietyOFC|You have to get hurt. That's how you learn.
AnxietyOFC|It's been a long time... Looks like I got  you off of my mind. But I can't, just the thought of you turns my whole world misty blue.
AnxietyOFC|The one thing I have taken from my past is that everything happens for a reason.
AnxietyOFC|Just know that I'm happy for you even if I can't understand.
AnxietyOFC|Don't take anyone for granted. Let them know how much you love them.
AnxietyOFC|I will do anything for you.
AnxietyOFC|I hate the way I love you.
AnxietyOFC|Hearing the words, “I miss you” from the right person is an amazing feeling.
AnxietyOFC|I maybe a bad girl, but I have goals.
AnxietyOFC|I love you that's why I'm letting you go.
AnxietyOFC|Whenever I am in a bad mood. All I want to do is listen a music.
AnxietyOFC|I want to be friends with everybody but it seems like nobody wants to be friends with me.
AnxietyOFC|Don't fix me if you're broken too.
AnxietyOFC|Till now I don't know the reason why he gave up.
AnxietyOFC|There's a story behind every person. There's a reason why they're the way they are. Think about that before you judge someone.
AnxietyOFC|I will wait for you because honestly I don't want anyone else.
AnxietyOFC|The only solution was to stand and fight.
AnxietyOFC|The only reason why I'm not yet killing myself cause I don't want to see my mother crying.
AnxietyOFC|Here comes the feelings you thought you've forgotten, here comes the pain that once left your heart broken.
AnxietyOFC|People cry not because love ends. But because it still continues even if its over.
AnxietyOFC|That moment when you can actually feel the pain in your chest from seeing or hearing something that breaks your heart.
AnxietyOFC|Sembreak is almost over.
AnxietyOFC|I stalk you a lot.
AnxietyOFC|We're not perfect. We're going to argue sometimes and have our problems but I'm never going to stop loving you. We're in this together.
AnxietyOFC|I need fast internet connection more than having a boyfriend.
AnxietyOFC|I'm sorry for being a mess.
AnxietyOFC|Sorry if I have trust issues.
AnxietyOFC|Admit it, sometimes you say your true feeling through jokes.
AnxietyOFC|Stop being so insensitive and start respecting other people's choices.
AnxietyOFC|Hi, how was your second day of November?
AnxietyOFC|I miss our memories, jokes, long conversations but I miss you the most.
AnxietyOFC|You’re always part of my prayers.
AnxietyOFC|If someone really loves you, they will never hurt you.
AnxietyOFC|Texting someone and falling asleep while waiting for the reply.
AnxietyOFC|Couples that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is meant to tear them apart and come out even stronger.
AnxietyOFC|Everytime I remember you, I always imagine our happy memories together.
AnxietyOFC|Fix my broken heart, please.
AnxietyOFC|Dear broken hearted, just wait till they realize what they lost.

AnxietyOFC|People now spending and wasting their time judging, bullying, and making fun for others.

AnxietyOFC|Attracted to you in ways that i can’t explain.
AnxietyOFC|I'm lost, somewhere in your heart.
AnxietyOFC|Life was never worse but never better.
AnxietyOFC|Effort is not a responsibility of a guy. It's the willingness of a guy to make his princess happy.
AnxietyOFC|I keep saving everyone except myself.
AnxietyOFC|One thing in life that I know for sure and that is, i will NEVER FORGET about YOU even AFTER YOU FORGET ME.
AnxietyOFC|To the person who hurt me. Thank you so much. You proved to me that promises are really made to be broken.
AnxietyOFC|Trust God even if you can't understand what's happening in your life.
AnxietyOFC|I miss you a lot. Be safe everyday.

AnxietyOFC|We are all dreamers, wanting to be completely out of touch with reality.
AnxietyOFC|The more unhappy we are, the more fake we've become.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes there's nothing left but to move on.
AnxietyOFC|Am I inlove with you? or Am I inlove with the feeling?
AnxietyOFC|I'm sorry I wasn't what you wanted.
AnxietyOFC|And suddenly, all the love songs were about you.
AnxietyOFC|I've been thingking too much, help me.
AnxietyOFC|So, I close my eyes to old ends and open my heart to new beginnings.
AnxietyOFC|I wish I could have you.

AnxietyOFC|When I am alone I can become invisible.
AnxietyOFC|How was the exam?
AnxietyOFC|Am I a burden to you?
AnxietyOFC|Quiet people have the loudest minds.
AnxietyOFC|People empty me. I have to get away to refill.
AnxietyOFC|I think a lot, but I don’t say much.

AnxietyOFC|Love is powerful.
AnxietyOFC|I badly need someone who can carried away the pain I felt.

AnxietyOFC|I don't know what is love all I know is I cared a lot.
AnxietyOFC|Stop asking me why did I let you go when infact you are the reason why I cry all day.
AnxietyOFC|I just wanna sit on a rooftop with someone at 2 am and just look at the night sky, not worrying about anything going on in life.

AnxietyOFC|Maybe I'm not enough.

Hold me tight.
Hold me closer to you.
Hold me tighter and never let me go.
Never let me go."
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes, the people who are thousands of miles away from you, can make you feel better than the person sitting right next to you.

AnxietyOFC|I thought this love would never end. But then, suddenly, it disappears.
AnxietyOFC|Love lies in those unsent drafts in your mailbox. Sometimes you wonder whether things would have been different if you'd clicked 'Send'.
AnxietyOFC|Silently hoping.
AnxietyOFC|We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.
AnxietyOFC|What's your semestral break plan?
AnxietyOFC|Deep conversations with open minded people are my most favourite things ever.
AnxietyOFC|Set her/him free, make her/him happy.
AnxietyOFC|Forget him, block him. Delete him outta your life. Move on and start fresh.
AnxietyOFC|The only thing I know is this. I am full of wounds and still standing on my feet.
AnxietyOFC|"My heart finally said, ""enough is enough"""
AnxietyOFC|I love those friends that get angrier about situations you're in than you do.
AnxietyOFC|First, they fool you with the lies then they kill you with the truth.
AnxietyOFC|God answers when you least expect it.
AnxietyOFC|Have you ever been hurt and the place tries to heal a bit, and you just pull the scar off of it over and over again.
AnxietyOFC|I'm still hoping.
AnxietyOFC|I want to vanish at this moment, someone please kidnap me.
AnxietyOFC|The more I ignore you. The more  fall.
AnxietyOFC|With love, you should go ahead and take the risk of getting hurt because love is an amazing feeling.
AnxietyOFC|Never forget who ignored you when you needed them and who helped you before you even had to ask.
AnxietyOFC|Please tell me the reason why you left.
AnxietyOFC|I didn’t mean to fall in love but I did. And you didn’t mean to hurt me but you did.
AnxietyOFC|My love for you is over.
AnxietyOFC|Love is like water. We can't live without it.
AnxietyOFC|I hate how you act like I am so much to deal with when all I’ve done was sit here and let you repeatedly hurt me.
AnxietyOFC|I think, you'll have to move on.
AnxietyOFC|"How would you react when your crush tell you this ""you're cute."""
AnxietyOFC|It's time to let you go.
AnxietyOFC|Compliments isn't important when it's used to fool you.
AnxietyOFC|I so loved hearing of your compliments.
AnxietyOFC|When your partner says, why are you so beautiful?
AnxietyOFC|Just go with the flow.
AnxietyOFC|I hope I can live my entire life with you.
AnxietyOFC|Self, long live!
AnxietyOFC|It's better to let all your tears fall rather than keeping them inside.
AnxietyOFC|Tears, can't you just stay away?
AnxietyOFC|I'm drowning in my own tears.
AnxietyOFC|I am drown by my pool of thoughts.
AnxietyOFC|I wish I could've read your mind.
AnxietyOFC|You are gradually becoming head of Medusa. Rays from your eyes are communicating with mine making me motionless like Lot's wife.
AnxietyOFC|You should've understand me first.
AnxietyOFC|All I need is you physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. Understand?
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes time is isn't enough.
AnxietyOFC|When it comes to you. I was like a selfish child gripping at those candies not sharing it.
AnxietyOFC|From a distance, I was in haste to meet you.
AnxietyOFC|Note that girls are abnormal.
AnxietyOFC|You will become famous when you're dead.
AnxietyOFC|I love how I drown in your eyes every time I stare.
AnxietyOFC|Keep your eyes locked on mine.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes failure teach us how to be strong and tough.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes your heart needs more time, to accept what your mind already knows.
AnxietyOFC|I just wanted you to notice me for who I am.
AnxietyOFC|If you love me why do you have to leave me.
AnxietyOFC|That feeling when you're not necessarily sad, but you just feel really empty.
AnxietyOFC|You said you were afraid to lose me then you faced your fears and left.
AnxietyOFC|Just because someone looks happy doesn't mean they are because even a white rose has a black shadow.
AnxietyOFC|I'm destroying myself but I'm too tired to care.
AnxietyOFC|I don't hate you. I never will. I just act like I do because it's easier than admitting I miss you.
AnxietyOFC|Please stay, I beg.
AnxietyOFC|God loves you no matter what.
AnxietyOFC|Why do I feel unwelcome with my friends?
AnxietyOFC|Don't worry, okay?
AnxietyOFC|Memories killing me.
AnxietyOFC|Want to know my talent? It's keeping pain inside and showing that I'm happy outside.
AnxietyOFC|If I could just programmed your mind to think of me everyday.
AnxietyOFC|Waiting for you to smile back at me.
AnxietyOFC|Can't change what your heart beats.
AnxietyOFC|You're killing me softly.
AnxietyOFC|People with high ego and unnecessary attitude deserves the standing ovation of the tallest finger.
AnxietyOFC|Suffocated by your lies.
AnxietyOFC|I'm dead inside.
AnxietyOFC|Pretending that you don't have feelings of anger, sadness, or loneliness can literally destroy you mentally.
AnxietyOFC|A kiss can be 10 times more effective than morphine in reducing pain by triggering the body's natural painkillers.
AnxietyOFC|When a person sleeps a lot, that person is lonely.
AnxietyOFC|When a person laugh too much, even on stupid things, that person is sad deep inside.
AnxietyOFC|When a person cries and the first  drop comes from the right eye, it's happiness. Left eye, pain. Both, frustration.
AnxietyOFC|If your girlfriend seems to be in a bad mood, get her something to eat.

AnxietyOFC|People who care less about what people think of them tend to have a higher I.Q. than those who do.
AnxietyOFC|Be that Shopping Cart with the bad wheel. Go in your own direction no matter how hard someone try's to push you in theirs.
AnxietyOFC|Some people accidentally walk on my feet and apologize, while others walk all over my heart and don't even realize.
AnxietyOFC|I didn't believe in luck. I believe in God.
AnxietyOFC|It hurts, but it's okay. I'm used to it.
AnxietyOFC|Your destiny isn't tied to anybody who left. So let them go if they want to.
AnxietyOFC|It's pain that helps grow into your highest self.
AnxietyOFC|Easiest way to die? Love someone who'll never love you back. You'll surely die everyday.
AnxietyOFC|The most painful situation in life is when we are waiting for dear one without even knowing that they are avoiding us.
AnxietyOFC|Nothing could ever love you like I do.
AnxietyOFC|I'll never give up.

AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/DpsEQz2BUN
AnxietyOFC|Good morning anxiety readers! Keep safe and start your day with a prayer.
AnxietyOFC|So lucky because I experienced your love and care even in a short period of time only.
AnxietyOFC|The person I love in the past left literally.
AnxietyOFC|Got no time for fake people in my life.
AnxietyOFC|No time for love. I am hungry.
AnxietyOFC|My happy pill was gone.
AnxietyOFC|Don't ignore a cute like me.
AnxietyOFC|Ignore me again and I'll show you what you've lost in a day.
AnxietyOFC|When I'm happy I enjoy the music. But when I'm sad, I understand the lyrics.

AnxietyOFC|Everytime you ignore my message, you don't know how much it hurts.
AnxietyOFC|I need you again.
AnxietyOFC|Please hug me so tight.
AnxietyOFC|Save me from darkness.
AnxietyOFC|Life isn't better when there are enemies.
AnxietyOFC|Love a person who can make you happy everytime that you're sad.
AnxietyOFC|6 months of being friends and still I'm just your best option when you're bored.
AnxietyOFC|Life is better with friens.
AnxietyOFC|Crying without sound.
AnxietyOFC|Until now, you can't see my worth.
AnxietyOFC|If we are not meant to be, can we?
AnxietyOFC|Can you teach me how to forget him?
AnxietyOFC|We are all worth it, but temporary.
AnxietyOFC|Don't catch feelings, crash them!
AnxietyOFC|"I've been played.
I've been lied. 
I've been cheated. 
But I'm still trying to love like I was never been hurt before."
AnxietyOFC|Lord, I want your warm tight hug.
AnxietyOFC|Lord, thank for surrounding us with your love in times when my thoughts wage into war.
AnxietyOFC|I will wait.
AnxietyOFC|I longed for your embrace.
AnxietyOFC|Can you please exist in this world?
AnxietyOFC|Letting go is a sign that you love that person so much.
AnxietyOFC|When a person tells you that you hurt them, you don’t get to decide that you didn’t.
AnxietyOFC|And then, the first day is already done.
AnxietyOFC|It's so hard to love a person who can't love us back.
AnxietyOFC|Should I stop this feeling?
AnxietyOFC|Can I rest now?
AnxietyOFC|It's so hard to ignore someone who used to talk everyday.
AnxietyOFC|This is not the right time, I guess
AnxietyOFC|It's your dishonesty that keeps on telling me that you don't deserve my love.
AnxietyOFC|I can't let you go.
AnxietyOFC|You don't always need a plan. Sometimes you just need to breath, trust, let go, and see what happens.
AnxietyOFC|If someone leaves let them go it's not your lost anyway.
AnxietyOFC|People will usually hurt you in attempt to heal themselves.
AnxietyOFC|Does it bother you that we barely ever talk?
AnxietyOFC|Love is all we need baby.
AnxietyOFC|Love doesn't destroy you, insecurities do.
AnxietyOFC|We loved each other at the wrong time.
AnxietyOFC|Let's just live and what happens will happen.
AnxietyOFC|I don't know why I'm still into you.
AnxietyOFC|I'm not sad anymore, just tired of this place.
AnxietyOFC|Stuck in a generation where love is just a qoute and lying is the new truth.
AnxietyOFC|I'm loyal, but I ain't stupid.
AnxietyOFC|I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want.
AnxietyOFC|Rule#2: Stop hoping.
AnxietyOFC|I took so much time to reset my life but in just one look, I am back to being stupid.
AnxietyOFC|If I could just use glutathione to brighten up my darkest days.
AnxietyOFC|I still love you but we need space to see things clearly.
AnxietyOFC|I have this feeling that this year I'll feel different but it never happens.
AnxietyOFC|"I like that we say ""oh, man"" to express disappointment. Because men are, in fact, disappointing."
AnxietyOFC|Simple person who hides a thousand feelings behind the happiest smile.
AnxietyOFC|Let me be the only one baby.
AnxietyOFC|My biggest mistake wasn't falling for you, it was thinking you had fallen for me too.
AnxietyOFC|Someday I'll be someone's priority.
AnxietyOFC|Everybody ain't your friend they're just scared to be your enemy.
AnxietyOFC|When would you set me free?
AnxietyOFC|"-What happened to you?
- I grew up."
AnxietyOFC|Monsters in our head is scarier than the monsters under our bed.
AnxietyOFC|Stocked between giving up and letting you go.
AnxietyOFC|Tears for sale.
AnxietyOFC|Who's willing to have my heart?
AnxietyOFC|I can't lose you this time.
AnxietyOFC|You're cute for me and that's what matters the most.
AnxietyOFC|Empty stomach is better than an empty heart.
AnxietyOFC|Forever isn't enough for me to show how much I loved and cared for you.
AnxietyOFC|There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds.
AnxietyOFC|I'm on the corner watching you kiss her.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes your eyes are not the only place the tears fall from.
AnxietyOFC|I love you to the point that words aren’t enough.
AnxietyOFC|It's okay to cry baby.
AnxietyOFC|I’d rather spend one moment holding you than a lifetime knowing I never could.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes I wish I were a little kid again, skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts.
AnxietyOFC|What's your 6:11 PM thoughts?
AnxietyOFC|Wishing that, this hell week ends.
AnxietyOFC|Even though I cry, nobody and no one will care.
AnxietyOFC|When there is a teamwork, there is a success.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes a good cry is just what you need to release all the hurt you have built up inside.
AnxietyOFC|Maybe I'm smiling but it still hurts.
AnxietyOFC|One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: That word is love.
AnxietyOFC|So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.
AnxietyOFC|Love is so short, forgetting is so long.
AnxietyOFC|Hearing the words, “I miss you” from the right person is an amazing feeling.
AnxietyOFC|Your voice is my favorite music.
AnxietyOFC|Nothing hurts more than being option.
AnxietyOFC|Let's stop discrimination, please.
AnxietyOFC|Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
AnxietyOFC|You hurt me more than what I deserve because I loved you more than what you deserve.
AnxietyOFC|One of the most courageous decision you’ll ever make is to finally let go of what is hurting your heart and soul.
AnxietyOFC|Anger is our natural defense against pain. So when I say I hate you, it really means you hurt me.

AnxietyOFC|I don't like what I'm becoming.
AnxietyOFC|You are too out of my league.
AnxietyOFC|Morning seems so far away.
AnxietyOFC|It's only you in my mind this morning.
AnxietyOFC|May you have the knowledge to answer all your questionnaire sheets.
AnxietyOFC|Mention the person you miss the most.
AnxietyOFC|Disappointed but not surprised.
AnxietyOFC|Good luck examinees!
AnxietyOFC|God is good all the time.
AnxietyOFC|Hello crush! Hope you'll notice me.
AnxietyOFC|Do you now feel the essence if Christmas?
AnxietyOFC|Thanks Jesus for this wonderful morning!
AnxietyOFC|I really like creepy story.
AnxietyOFC|Did you now study?
AnxietyOFC|Cheating is a crime.
AnxietyOFC|Hold your books not your phone.
AnxietyOFC|"Goodluck to those have Examination tomorrow,
just pray and ask help to God."
AnxietyOFC|Learn to be alone cause no one will stay.
AnxietyOFC|Can you sent us an angel so that we can pass.
AnxietyOFC|For tonight, I want chocolates, french fries, ice cream, and you.
AnxietyOFC|I'm weak outside. But deep within, you'll not expect how rigid my heart is.
AnxietyOFC|Music heals, But sometimes the lyrics kills.
AnxietyOFC|Guide us tomorrow G!
AnxietyOFC|To me you are special.
AnxietyOFC|Spread goodvibes!
AnxietyOFC|Thank you for making me realize what exactly forever feels like.
AnxietyOFC|Heal this broken heart Lord.
AnxietyOFC|I'm still beautiful without make up. That's how great I adore myself.
AnxietyOFC|Good night everyone! May the man in your dream be with all forever.
AnxietyOFC|No more tears to cry.
AnxietyOFC|Ignoring my messages won't make you look cute.
AnxietyOFC|"Dear God,
Please help me for tomorrow."
AnxietyOFC|You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you mad.
AnxietyOFC|Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you.
AnxietyOFC|Can I hug you tonight?
AnxietyOFC|I am so damn weak.
AnxietyOFC|When the angels ask what I most loved about life, I'll say you.
AnxietyOFC|"My ""last seen at"" was just to check your ""last seen at""."
AnxietyOFC|Hi is a short, simple word but it's how love starts.
AnxietyOFC|I want you today and tomorrow and next week and for the rest of my life.
AnxietyOFC|If you ever ask me how many times you’ve crossed my mind, I would say once. Because you came, and never left.
AnxietyOFC|Someone has stolen my heart and you are the highest on my list of suspects.
AnxietyOFC|I am so totally, completely, overwhelmingly, eye-poppingly, life-changingly, spectacularly, passionately, deliciously in love with you.
AnxietyOFC|I canʼt say hello to you and risk another goodbye.
AnxietyOFC|Darling, your looks can kill.
AnxietyOFC|I wish I had a delete button in my life. Not to erase some nemories but to erase some feelings.
AnxietyOFC|Follow your heart, it knows the way.
AnxietyOFC|Yeah, I know he’s cute, but he’s mine. Touch him and I’ll kill you.
AnxietyOFC|Memories don't bother me. The feelings did.
AnxietyOFC|Donʼt be ashamed of you. Itʼs your parentʼs job.
AnxietyOFC|As you read these words, know that right at this moment, there is someone who is thinking about you and cares about you.
AnxietyOFC|Swear I am normal.
AnxietyOFC|Smile. It destroys who want to destroy you.
AnxietyOFC|A real man chooses to honor, love, adore, respect and be faithful to one woman only. I am glad you are my man.
AnxietyOFC|She's hurt but still she stayed.
AnxietyOFC|I'm much more me when I'm with you.
AnxietyOFC|No, he’s not perfect. He’s human and he’s flawed, but he’s perfect to me and that’s all that matters.
AnxietyOFC|You are so beautiful.
AnxietyOFC|The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to these things. You meet someone and you fall in love and that's that.
AnxietyOFC|"Seenzone and likezone, means you're
just nothing to him/her."
AnxietyOFC|Now, only music comforts me. Coz nobody does.
AnxietyOFC|I won't give up, even if the skies get rough.
AnxietyOFC|Do please hear out my silent cry.
AnxietyOFC|Please, don't change.
AnxietyOFC|I’m not mad. I’m hurt. There’s a difference.
AnxietyOFC|Can someone congratulate me for being a great pretender?
AnxietyOFC|I should've never let you go.
AnxietyOFC|I'm tired. It keeps repeating. I know no one would ever try to stay in my life. Ever.
AnxietyOFC|Please stop hurting yourself.
AnxietyOFC|Pain changed me.
AnxietyOFC|Thank you for the support.
AnxietyOFC|Tired of being compared.
AnxietyOFC|Pretending that you're not totally sad is never easy.
AnxietyOFC|Are you okay?
AnxietyOFC|Now, how does it feel after loosing me?
AnxietyOFC|I have many friends but none of them ask me if I'm still okay.
AnxietyOFC|You don't have to be strong all the time. Let it hurt you until it can't hurt anymore.
AnxietyOFC|Mention the person who makes you happy always.
AnxietyOFC|I want to make things right.
AnxietyOFC|Fake people giving fake love.
AnxietyOFC|When I'm gone, you’ll gonna miss how much I cared.
AnxietyOFC|Stay close to me, please.
AnxietyOFC|You'll gonna miss me when I'm gone.
AnxietyOFC|Learn to appreciate things while it's still there.
AnxietyOFC|I'm tired but I have goals.
AnxietyOFC|You will never see the true value of a person until they are gone.
AnxietyOFC|Here I am again thinking of the possible ways to forget you.
AnxietyOFC|I'm just a human.
AnxietyOFC|Isn’t it sad when you get hurt so much, you can finally say “I’m used to it.
AnxietyOFC|Babe, don't forget your dinner.
AnxietyOFC|"I missed your jokes.
I missed your hugs. 
I missed your kisses. 
I missed the smiles that we shared. 
I missed every piece of you."
AnxietyOFC|If he hurts your feelings. Don't forget to tell me I'll be here waiting for you.
AnxietyOFC|Too late to change.
AnxietyOFC|I miss the old us.
AnxietyOFC|Everytime I heard your name tears me apart.
AnxietyOFC|Too cute for you to hurt.
AnxietyOFC|I can't forget you!
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes you just have to wonder how many times someone you care about has to hurt you before you finally don’t care.
AnxietyOFC|Your message is my happiness.
AnxietyOFC|Kiss me.
AnxietyOFC|When reality is bigger than your dreams.
AnxietyOFC|I want to stay with you until we're  gray and old.
AnxietyOFC|Accept the situation and move on.
AnxietyOFC|You can't dictate someone's feelings.
AnxietyOFC|Pretending you don't have feelings of anger, sadness, or loneliness can literally destroy you mentally.
AnxietyOFC|Goals are dreams with deadlines.
AnxietyOFC|If you are not big enough to lose, you are not big enough to win.
AnxietyOFC|Emotions can certainly be misleading, they can fool you into believing stuff that is definitely, demonstrably untrue.
AnxietyOFC|I can't deny my feelings for you.

AnxietyOFC|Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option.
AnxietyOFC|If you could read my mind. You would be in tears.
AnxietyOFC|When you’ve been strong for so long, sometimes you just need time to be alone and let your tears out.
AnxietyOFC|I need you by my side.
AnxietyOFC|I don’t want to get attached to anyone, anymore.
AnxietyOFC|Being sad is not easy.
AnxietyOFC|I'm gonna be the love that lasts.
AnxietyOFC|That moment when you can actually feel the pain in your chest from seeing or hearing something that breaks your heart.
AnxietyOFC|No turning back.
AnxietyOFC|Just let it out and cry.
AnxietyOFC|The heart is the only broken instrument that works.
AnxietyOFC|You can choose your friends but you can't choose your enemies.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes, when one person is missing, the whole world seems depopulated.
AnxietyOFC|My heart keeps on telling me to love you, but my mind says I must let you go.
AnxietyOFC|Pain is your friend. It lets you know that you're still alive.
AnxietyOFC|Never be afraid to try something new. Remember, amateurs build the ark ; professionals built the Titanic.
AnxietyOFC|I'd rather sleep than seeing you having an affair with my bestfriend.
AnxietyOFC|I always mean what I say but I don't always say what I mean.
AnxietyOFC|Experience is the hardest kind of teacher. It gives you the test first, and the lesson afterwards.
AnxietyOFC|Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.
AnxietyOFC|Being with you feels like home.
AnxietyOFC|Take this advice: know when to stay and when to get out.
AnxietyOFC|"Someday, I can be someone's ""My day""."
AnxietyOFC|You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.
AnxietyOFC|Promise me you'll never forget me because if I thought you would, I'd never leave.
AnxietyOFC|I wished I can go back time where we used to be.
AnxietyOFC|I dreamed last night that your mine already,  but I realized that it was just a dream.
AnxietyOFC|A super wide campus, but my eyes can still find you anyway.
AnxietyOFC|Spill everything here.
AnxietyOFC|The person you care for the most, is the person you’ll let hurt you the most.
AnxietyOFC|If you get tired learn to rest not to quit.
AnxietyOFC|Learn taking risks.
AnxietyOFC|Don't just stay in your comfort zone.
AnxietyOFC|Leave the pain and find your happiness.
AnxietyOFC|I don't wanna love again. Co'z I know that I'll get hurt in the end.
AnxietyOFC|"You are my world. 
You are my life.
You are my happiness.
You are my future.
You are my soul. 
You are my everything. 
So please stay."
AnxietyOFC|Singing in the shower helps boost your immunity, lower blood pressure, reduce stress, and improve your mood.
AnxietyOFC|Smile gorgeous.
AnxietyOFC|Did you know that the human mind spends most of its time waiting, hoping and wishing for something that may not happen.
AnxietyOFC|Secret fact: The brain purposely forgets certain memories in order to avoid information overload and emotional hangovers.
AnxietyOFC|Whatever lost will always be replaced.
AnxietyOFC|What's your greatest fear?
AnxietyOFC|It is very painful to see our loved one happy with someone else.
AnxietyOFC|Drop down a message for your bestfriend.
AnxietyOFC|It hurts when you have someone in your heart but you can't have him in your arms.
AnxietyOFC|Give yourself a break. Don't stress too much.
AnxietyOFC|"We fall.
We break.
We fail.
But then,
We rise.
We heal.
We overcome."
AnxietyOFC|"I wanted to talk about it. I wanted to scream. I wanted to yell. I wanted to shout about it. But all I could do was to whisper ""I'm fine."""
AnxietyOFC|Don't give up. Just rest yourself.
AnxietyOFC|Maturity is when you accept the negative criticisms professionally and won't give a fuss about it.
AnxietyOFC|"Girls:
Be 16
Looking 18
Acting 21

Guys:
Be 21
Looking 18
Acting 16"
AnxietyOFC|My toxic trait? I'll see something that hurts my feelings, won't say anything and let you wonder why I'm acting different.
AnxietyOFC|Take the risk or lose the chance.
AnxietyOFC|I don't hate you. I hate what you did to me.
AnxietyOFC|We used to talk everyday but it comes to this point that the always will now be never and the lovers will now be strangers.
AnxietyOFC|Everybody needs someone who can make them laugh when they think that they’ll never smile again.
AnxietyOFC|Can you please give me foods?
AnxietyOFC|If we're not really meant to be, then I'll just treasure those precious moments with you and me.
AnxietyOFC|This pain I feel is all worth it in the end.
AnxietyOFC|"Tired of crying. 
Tired of being broken.
Tired of pleasing everyone. 
Tired of caring. 
Tired of pretending.
Tired… https://t.co/EcTLVFoyCt"
AnxietyOFC|Smile, even if it's fake. Laugh, even if you hurt. Don't let anyone get to you, you're beautiful regardless of what anyone says to you.
AnxietyOFC|Stop wasting time to those not worth your time.
AnxietyOFC|Honesty has so much difference from loyalty. Remember that.
AnxietyOFC|I'm so in loved with you. Die hope you know.
AnxietyOFC|I am using what's yours. And you were using what's mine.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes, the best way to get someone’s attention is to stop giving them yours.
AnxietyOFC|Make sure your words are sweet in case you need to eat them someday.
AnxietyOFC|I dont want to be your whole life. Just your favorite part.
AnxietyOFC|"Your simple ""good morning"" means a lot to me."
AnxietyOFC|I want you right now.
AnxietyOFC|Letting you go is the worst decision I've ever done.
AnxietyOFC|My eyes stocked on you. But your eyes stocked on others.
AnxietyOFC|I want to know how to unlove you.
AnxietyOFC|Don't demean yourself like that. Because you deserve so much more.
AnxietyOFC|To much pain will kill you.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/cqiGOx9xxV
AnxietyOFC|Yes, I smile because I deserve!
AnxietyOFC|Love. Is that an animal? Or a plant? Tell me, I don't know what it is.
AnxietyOFC|Good morning Lord! Thank you for this other chance to live. God Bless everyone! Keep safe.
AnxietyOFC|I think I am afraid to be happy. Because whenever I get too happy, something bad always happens.
AnxietyOFC|The worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you know you can never have them.
AnxietyOFC|2 am rants?
AnxietyOFC|Distance means so little when someone means so much.
AnxietyOFC|Give me a goodnight message. Anyone?
AnxietyOFC|Be aware because I don't have patience.
AnxietyOFC|Take your time. Patience is the key and you will see.
AnxietyOFC|Can someone hold my hand and let me feel that I am not worthless?
AnxietyOFC|You're wonderful tonight!
AnxietyOFC|Don't be afraid, I am always here.
AnxietyOFC|I don't need attention I just need support.
AnxietyOFC|I am yours and you are mine.
AnxietyOFC|I was like a robot impowered by your electromagnetic red lips.
AnxietyOFC|The worst feeling when your boyfriend/girlfriend is not proud to be with you.
AnxietyOFC|Nobody loves me like you do.
AnxietyOFC|I care for you so please just trust me.
AnxietyOFC|I hope I can be your shoulder to cry on.
AnxietyOFC|I cared for you.
AnxietyOFC|Nothing hurts so much than ignoring me in front of your friends.
AnxietyOFC|I want to be your pillow tonight.
AnxietyOFC|I wish I mean a lot for you.
AnxietyOFC|I really want your warm hug, right now.
AnxietyOFC|So please be honest with me too.
AnxietyOFC|Tonight, I'll be honest with you.
AnxietyOFC|No measurement tools can measure my love for you.
AnxietyOFC|I am so lucky to have you.
AnxietyOFC|Why are relationships so painful that it sucks so much?
AnxietyOFC|I don't deserve this pain.
AnxietyOFC|Not having you tonight makes me mad.
AnxietyOFC|I don't want to see that you're unhappy being with me.
AnxietyOFC|Just please stay.
AnxietyOFC|Hurting a cute like me won't make you awesome.
AnxietyOFC|I'm used to it.
AnxietyOFC|It's hard waiting for something that'll never happen.
AnxietyOFC|I don't need you.
AnxietyOFC|I can't love anyone else the way I loved you.
AnxietyOFC|I'm not your priority so do whatever you want.
AnxietyOFC|I just can't stop myself thinking about you.
AnxietyOFC|You can stay but if you want to leave, I won't beg you nor plead you.
AnxietyOFC|I just want to be happy. But no one else can.
AnxietyOFC|It's been a year but damn I'm still missing you every second, every minute.
AnxietyOFC|I wished these five fingers could touch all of your edges. And have these intellectual sense of seeing to stare you from afar.
AnxietyOFC|No worries. Galaxies know your essence and it was drawn from stars.
AnxietyOFC|Had a date with myself.
AnxietyOFC|If you like me, say it. And if not, stop acting like you do.
AnxietyOFC|All I ask is you're honesty.
AnxietyOFC|Coz it's when I look at our pictures, there the pleasant memories lingers.
AnxietyOFC|Don't let them ruin your night.
AnxietyOFC|I want chocolate.
AnxietyOFC|Get lost.
AnxietyOFC|You don't know pain until you stare at yourself in the mirror with tears in your eyes, begging yourself to just hold on and be strong.
AnxietyOFC|A tear is made of 1% water and 99% feelings.
AnxietyOFC|I wanted you to stay but still you left.
AnxietyOFC|Sick!
AnxietyOFC|I'm sorry but I don't need someone who doesn't have common sense.
AnxietyOFC|You're the pill that awakens me, never let me weaken.
AnxietyOFC|Stop lying, please.
AnxietyOFC|Your attention is my satisfaction.
AnxietyOFC|Always treat others the way you want to be treated.
AnxietyOFC|Dear God, You're my everything.
AnxietyOFC|There are two types of pain in this world. Pain that hurts you and pain that changes you.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes you will never know the true value of a moment until it become’s a memory.
AnxietyOFC|People forgive you when lies are told and hate you when the truth is told.
AnxietyOFC|Keeping things in their right places.
AnxietyOFC|When you finally let go off the past, something better comes along.
AnxietyOFC|No matter what, remember that you are special.
AnxietyOFC|You're my magic, pixie dust and my stroke of wand.
AnxietyOFC|As long as that special person makes you happy, it shouldn’t matter what other people say.
AnxietyOFC|Your smile kills me. That's a fact!
AnxietyOFC|The problem is whenever we talk I fall in love over and over again.
AnxietyOFC|I wanted to travel around the world with the man I loved the most.
AnxietyOFC|It's a good feeling when you're always in love.
AnxietyOFC|I want my children saying, leave Romeo and Juliet, I want our love story to be like mom and dad.
AnxietyOFC|Love will always keep us alive.
AnxietyOFC|You miss him because he's gone.
AnxietyOFC|A teddy bear reminds me of your tenderness towards me. But sadly, that was just before.
AnxietyOFC|Do you ever want to just hug somebody and cry it all out.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/1FCgKDdTui
AnxietyOFC|Breaking my rules just for you.
AnxietyOFC|Learn how to wait for the good time intended.
AnxietyOFC|Pretending not to be hungry is never easy.
AnxietyOFC|I love you isn't enough. Prove it!
AnxietyOFC|"I miss you.
I want you.
I love you."
AnxietyOFC|Having you in my life even in a short period of time is priceless.
AnxietyOFC|Insisting myself to someone who didn't appreciate my presence. That's how pathetic I am.
AnxietyOFC|It's hard to watch people change right in front of you. But it's even harder remembering who they used to be.
AnxietyOFC|Why can't you just tell me what you feel. Because, how you act is confusing me.
AnxietyOFC|No one has the right to make anyone feel unhappy or unworthy.
AnxietyOFC|The beauty of the heart reigns forever.
AnxietyOFC|I wish I didn't exist.
AnxietyOFC|I need you to fight for us because I'm so tired fighting alone.
AnxietyOFC|Drop down the saddest song you know.
AnxietyOFC|I'm right over here, why can't you see me.
AnxietyOFC|No reason to stay, is a good reason to go.
AnxietyOFC|I want you to stay never go away from me. But then you left.
AnxietyOFC|I'm fine. No worries!
AnxietyOFC|All you have to do is stay.
AnxietyOFC|I do miss you, but I'm trying my best to stop caring.
AnxietyOFC|Never get too attached to something that isn't yours.
AnxietyOFC|As long as you are pretending, you will never be healed.
AnxietyOFC|And then suddenly, tears escaped from her eyes.
AnxietyOFC|Take a deep breath and just let it all go.
AnxietyOFC|Not friends, nor enemies. Just some strangers with memories.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes you just have to think if he's worth it.
AnxietyOFC|I consider this as one of the hell week.
AnxietyOFC|Heartbreak makes you a wise person.
AnxietyOFC|Everyone is looking for their forever, while me? I'm looking for my permanent because everyone stays temporarily.
AnxietyOFC|Learn to say no without explaining yourself.
AnxietyOFC|Still finding my worth.
AnxietyOFC|Everytime I'm looking at the sky, I imagine your face with a smile.
AnxietyOFC|"Dear self, 
Sorry if I can't do my best and however I took it harder and harder the more I feel stressed and I don'… https://t.co/MfoSMYpCfz"
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/2JHZozz2iV
AnxietyOFC|I feel so down but I still manage to smile always.
AnxietyOFC|Love never fails. So if it fail, it isn't love.
AnxietyOFC|"""Does it still hurt?"" 
Yes, And I think it always will, at least a little."
AnxietyOFC|Pain makes you stronger.
AnxietyOFC|True love would always find ways to understand pain.
AnxietyOFC|What's your most kind of heartache?
AnxietyOFC|You're wonderful baby.
AnxietyOFC|Im always here for you. I will stay and won't ever leave you.
AnxietyOFC|You've hurt me but I still love you.
AnxietyOFC|I love you and it's priceless.
AnxietyOFC|I was born to be wild and free.
AnxietyOFC|Stressed but still beautiful.
AnxietyOFC|"That moment when you beg yourself to stop crying and tell yourself ""be strong."""
AnxietyOFC|Note to self: stop expecting.
AnxietyOFC|How I wish to stand by your side forever.
AnxietyOFC|Usually, people think that I'm a strong, happy person but behind my smiles they just don't know how much I'm in pain and almost broken.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/j8VfqkA7QD
AnxietyOFC|Help me get over you.
AnxietyOFC|One picture, thousands memories.
AnxietyOFC|Stalking your timeline makes me cry.
AnxietyOFC|I'm busy doing nothing.
AnxietyOFC|Don't be afraid of coming back to me. I will surely accept you anytime.
AnxietyOFC|Everything's going to be alright. Not now, but eventually.
AnxietyOFC|I need you now.
AnxietyOFC|I can't live without you. Just like the sky without the dragons, the forest without it's fairies and the ocean without its mermaid.
AnxietyOFC|Your my great distraction, yet inspiration.
AnxietyOFC|Be limitless!
AnxietyOFC|Whatever your emotion is. Masked it with smile.
AnxietyOFC|Love a guy who would respect you more than he respect himself.
AnxietyOFC|Once you feel you are avoided by someone, never disturb them again.
AnxietyOFC|Always find time for the things that make you feel happy to be alive.
AnxietyOFC|Let it all go. See what stays.
AnxietyOFC|People will change. When they lose interest in you.
AnxietyOFC|Don't judge a situation you've never been in.
AnxietyOFC|"If ""Plan A"" didn't work. The alphabet has 25 more letters. Stay cool."
AnxietyOFC|Stop trying so hard for people who don't care.
AnxietyOFC|Don't think so much you'll create a problem that wasn't even there in the first place.
AnxietyOFC|Make yourself a priority once in a while. It's not selfish. It's necessary .
AnxietyOFC|Don't stop when you are tired, stop when you are done.
AnxietyOFC|Stop looking for happiness in the same place you lost it.
AnxietyOFC|Pretending to be happy is never easy.
AnxietyOFC|If the plan doesn't work , change the plan but never the goal.
AnxietyOFC|Know when to walk away from toxic people.
AnxietyOFC|It's been a week since he left.
AnxietyOFC|I love you more than you think.
AnxietyOFC|I will wait for yo because honestly I don't want anyone else.
AnxietyOFC|Where there is love, there is pain.
AnxietyOFC|I wanted to cry under the rain. Because I know that nobody will ever hear my pain.
AnxietyOFC|Goodbye without reasons is the most painful one.
AnxietyOFC|Physically strong. Emotionally and Mentally exhausted.
AnxietyOFC|If it's God plan, it'll happen.
AnxietyOFC|Can't do anything but to accept that you're gone and you're not here with me.
AnxietyOFC|One day, I hope you look back at what we had, and regret every single thing to let it end.
AnxietyOFC|I need to face the reality.
AnxietyOFC|Can't forget that date when we end up everything.
AnxietyOFC|It hurts when you realize that you aren't as important to someone as you thought you were.
AnxietyOFC|There are two types of pain. One that hurts you and one that changes you.
AnxietyOFC|Wise enough to forgive and strong enough to move-on.
AnxietyOFC|A wonderful morning everyone!
AnxietyOFC|Dying inside but still smiling.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/GRpTD8gn2T
AnxietyOFC|Judge me all you want. Well, I don't care! I know what I've done and it's much real than your lies.
AnxietyOFC|You're not mine but I still love you.
AnxietyOFC|Do you love that person in your wallpaper?
AnxietyOFC|Leaving is never easy specially when you'll also leave someone special to you.
AnxietyOFC|I wouldn't cry for you if I don't love you.
AnxietyOFC|I take one step away and I find myself coming back to you.
AnxietyOFC|You're ignoring me but I still love you.
AnxietyOFC|Sorry, I just misunderstood you're response.
AnxietyOFC|The problem when you get too attached to someone is when they leave. You just feel lost.
AnxietyOFC|I'm okay.
AnxietyOFC|If you wanna forget me just say so.
AnxietyOFC|Can you please tell me why you suddenly change?
AnxietyOFC|Tryiny to forget someone damn it I know it's not easy, I've been there
AnxietyOFC|I wanna read your last line, not last message.
AnxietyOFC|You broke my heart, but I still love you with all the pieces.
AnxietyOFC|It's definitely difficult in love, when you're going to remove someone special in your life.
AnxietyOFC|Love doesn't hurt, expectations do.
AnxietyOFC|"The most beautiful line is ""but, I love you"" and the most painful line is ""I love you, but."""
AnxietyOFC|When I close my eyes, I see you. When I open my eyes, I miss you.
AnxietyOFC|Keep loving baby.
AnxietyOFC|If you left me without reason, do not come back without an excuse.
AnxietyOFC|My memory loves you. It asks about you all the time.
AnxietyOFC|No matter how busy the person is, if they really care, they'll always find the time for you.
AnxietyOFC|Painful moment is when you hear your loved one busy for another call for a long time.
AnxietyOFC|Seriously, I miss your wide smile. I miss your laugh. I miss your dance. I miss your golden voice. I miss all about… https://t.co/GDf3UqQdE6
AnxietyOFC|I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing.
AnxietyOFC|When everthing's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am.
AnxietyOFC|Date someone who is interested in you.
AnxietyOFC|It's sad nobody ever knows how much someone is actually hurting.
AnxietyOFC|"""Who hurt you?""
""My own expectations."""
AnxietyOFC|I'm afraid to lose you. So please stay.
AnxietyOFC|I shouldn't love you this much!
AnxietyOFC|I love you but you left so easily.
AnxietyOFC|The truth will set you free.
AnxietyOFC|I can see the pain in your eyes.
AnxietyOFC|All that I feel is my love for you.
AnxietyOFC|Don't expect too much!
AnxietyOFC|I can sleep even though I am sad.
AnxietyOFC|I always share the story of my life but any one don't want to listen.
AnxietyOFC|Stay close to me and I'll keep you safe.
AnxietyOFC|Letting you go because you deserve it.
AnxietyOFC|It's okay to imagine.
AnxietyOFC|I think I'm inlove again.
AnxietyOFC|Fake friends are like shadows. They follow you in the sun but leave you in the dark.
AnxietyOFC|Pray before you sleep.
AnxietyOFC|Sometimes it’s not the people who change, it’s the mask that falls off.
AnxietyOFC|Stay real, stay loyal, or stay away from me.
AnxietyOFC|Night depression attacks!
AnxietyOFC|Always get the happiness you deserve.
AnxietyOFC|I have 3 bestfriends:me, myself, and I.
AnxietyOFC|I've learned a valuable lesson be nice and everyone will hurt you.
AnxietyOFC|I'm secretly hurt inside. So I prefer to keep the distance from you and ignore you. And act like we're just stranger.
AnxietyOFC|The heart that loves, can't just love alone. It hopes, too. And I don't want to hope. I'm sick of it.
AnxietyOFC|Words can't bring me down.
AnxietyOFC|Love is a poison. Happiness should not come from other  people. It should come from yourself. Love gives you an ill… https://t.co/7OSfUIuQ6q
AnxietyOFC|"Dear Memories,
Not now please!"
AnxietyOFC|When you're in pain, you can't expect people to feel pain, too. Some might even rejoice when you're sad. Thats the way life goes.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/nOI5P4hcF9
AnxietyOFC|I never regret the day I've met you.
AnxietyOFC|Can't forget the day we started talking.
AnxietyOFC|I was the one who loved you even though you gave me a thousand reason not to.
AnxietyOFC|Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.
AnxietyOFC|"Can you hear the silence? 
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel my heart?!"
AnxietyOFC|Pretending to be happy is just an example of how strong person you are.
AnxietyOFC|You always remember me. But you love another person.
AnxietyOFC|Don't insist yourself to someone who don't like you.
AnxietyOFC|https://t.co/oAeagRw6OU
AnxietyOFC|Tell me not to cry, when you were gone.
AnxietyOFC|Don't mind me. I'm fine.
AnxietyOFC|I wish you were here.
AnxietyOFC|I wish that was just a dream.
AnxietyOFC|Don't waste your time on someone who don't see your worth.
AnxietyOFC|You're important to me. Understand?
AnxietyOFC|No one can replace your worth.
AnxietyOFC|Hope you'll never come back. I'm physically and emotionally tired of understanding your attitude.
AnxietyOFC|He left literally.
AnxietyOFC|You'll forever in my heart.
AnxietyOFC|It hurts that you moved on.
AnxietyOFC|Thank you so much!
AnxietyOFC|A wonderful feeling when you make your parents proud.
AnxietyOFC|Tired but cute.
AnxietyOFC|The sun has settled down. Would you like to greet me good evening?
AnxietyOFC|Be someone's reason why they are smiling not the reason why they are hurting.
AnxietyOFC|People see my action. God looks my intention.
AnxietyOFC|Thank you for the memories.
AnxietyOFC|I need you now.
AnxietyOFC|Someday, you'll realize how much I cared cor you.
AnxietyOFC|Did you ever cried at night?
AnxietyOFC|My eyes stocked on you.
AnxietyOFC|Let us all cultivate a culture of praise.
AnxietyOFC|I need you each and everyday.
AnxietyOFC|I think I'm in love again with the wrong person. Damn!
AnxietyOFC|I miss you so damn much, love!
AnxietyOFC|I did my best. But I guess my best wasn't good enough.
AnxietyOFC|I am beautiful as always. They're words can never bring me down.
AnxietyOFC|I will never let you fall. I'll stand-up with you forever!
AnxietyOFC|Be the best you can be.
AnxietyOFC|Why do I feel so worthless every time I'm with my friends.
AnxietyOFC|We are like parallel lines, we will never met no matter how far we are extended even though we are heading in the s… https://t.co/tY8kdkaloe
AnxietyOFC|Lord, help me please.
AnxietyOFC|Falling in love is easy, but staying in love everyday is special.
AnxietyOFC|Would you still love me if I tell you that I am sick?
AnxietyOFC|Another chance, please.
AnxietyOFC|Missing those sweet smiles of yours.
AnxietyOFC|I miss those tight hugs of yours.
AnxietyOFC|"The hardest decision in life is deciding whether to ""walk away"" or ""try harder."""
AnxietyOFC|If everything seems to be coming your way, you're probably in the wrong lane.
AnxietyOFC|The best is yet to come. Be patient.
AnxietyOFC|Nothing hurts more than being ignored, replaced , forgotten , or lied to.
AnxietyOFC|Everyone deserves a second chance but not for the same mistake.
AnxietyOFC|I lost my smile again.
AnxietyOFC|You gotta remember that life goes on even without the people you thought would be there 'til the end.
AnxietyOFC|Come back and be with me.
AnxietyOFC|Have you ever been in pain that you actually feel your heart barely beating .
AnxietyOFC|Knowing that you'll not coming back is like breaking my heart into pieces.
AnxietyOFC|You’re in a relationship to be happy, to smile, to laugh and to make good memories. Not to constantly be upset, to feel hurt and to cry.
AnxietyOFC|It is not the pain. It’s who it came from.
AnxietyOFC|I’m sad, hurt, angry, mad, and disappointed. But you know what? I’ll put on a smile and move on. It will hurt but I will survive.
AnxietyOFC|It hurts knowing you tried doing your best and it still wasn’t good enough.
AnxietyOFC|So lets pretend that the pain I feel everyday is nothing.
AnxietyOFC|The pain started years ago, but I’d lived with it for so long at that point that I’d accepted it as an inevitable part of me.
AnxietyOFC|Nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the single person you thought would never hurt you.
AnxietyOFC|I don't care about those people who judge me. I'm just gonna do what makes me happy in life.
AnxietyOFC|I'm just here waiting if you need me.
AnxietyOFC|I love you baby. Only death do us part.
AnxietyOFC|A blessed morning everyone! Let's start our day with a smile and a happy heart.
AnxietyOFC|Thank you for all the happy memories.
AnxietyOFC|Can't stop myself thinking negative things.
AnxietyOFC|As I wait in time, I dream of us together.
AnxietyOFC|Start your day with God.
AnxietyOFC|In those stolen moments that I stared at you, I saw that there was once a spark in those eyes of yours.
AnxietyOFC|You're not mine anymore, but I'm still yours.
AnxietyOFC|Just let it go, just let it be, let the ashes fall, forget about me.
AnxietyOFC|I stay home alone, listening to music and thinking too much.
AnxietyOFC|Music takes us somewhere we cannot go and shows us things we cannot see.
AnxietyOFC|Hating you because you compared me to others.
AnxietyOFC|Yes I smile but you don't know what's behind it.
AnxietyOFC|I am mad and at the same time I wan't to laugh because you act like you're fool.
